1. maximum path sum in a binary tree (golbal ans, and return root + l or r)
2. wiggle sort (odd and even swap)
3. find lowest common ansestor in bst ()
5. wiggle sort 2 (fill new sorted array with mid-- and high--)
2. find the path from top left to bottom right path in a binary maze (r-1, r+1, c-1, c+1) (queue.add(new int[] {i, j, dist + 1}))
1. insert, delete , getRandom in contant time (map and linked list) (last element swap)
4. given the head of a linked list reverse the nodes of a list k at a time and return the modified list (tail = k+1)(reverse and put head.next)
6. populating next right pointer in each node 2 (dummy.next, dummy, 2 for loops)
 Longest Repeating Character Replacement (window, maxcount + k < r - l + 1)
