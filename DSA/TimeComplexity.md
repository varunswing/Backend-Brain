Estimating the time complexity of a coding problem is essential for designing efficient solutions, especially when constraints are given. Here’s a guide on how to guess the approximate time complexity based on typical constraints:

### 1. **Understanding Time Limits and Operations per Second**
   - In coding competitions, a program is usually expected to run within 1 to 2 seconds.
   - Most online judges handle about **10⁸ operations per second**, so use this as a baseline to estimate feasible time complexities.

### 2. **Mapping Constraints to Feasible Complexities**
   - Based on the input constraints, you can infer what time complexity is manageable within the allowed time limit:

| Constraint (N)            | Feasible Complexity              | Explanation                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **N ≤ 10**                | `O(N!)`, `O(2^N)`               | Permutations or exhaustive search might be feasible. |
| **N ≤ 20**                | `O(2^N)`                        | Works for subsets, combinations, recursive searches. |
| **N ≤ 100**               | `O(N^3)`                        | Good for graph algorithms like Floyd-Warshall. |
| **N ≤ 1,000**             | `O(N^2)`                        | Suitable for DP problems, matrix operations. |
| **N ≤ 10^5**              | `O(N log N)`                    | Works for efficient sorting, binary search, and divide & conquer. |
| **N ≤ 10^6** to **10^7**  | `O(N)`                          | Linear-time algorithms are required, like counting and traversal. |
| **N > 10^8**              | `O(log N)` or `O(1)`            | Only very fast operations like binary search or simple arithmetic are feasible. |

### 3. **Estimating Complexity Based on Constraints Examples**
   - Let's look at common complexity levels for various constraints:

   - **Factorial Complexity (`O(N!)`)**  
     Suitable for problems with very small `N` (e.g., `N ≤ 10`). Common in exhaustive search problems like the Traveling Salesman or finding all permutations.

   - **Exponential Complexity (`O(2^N)`)**  
     Usually feasible for `N ≤ 20`. Problems requiring all subsets, combinations, or configurations (like the Knapsack problem) often have constraints in this range.

   - **Quadratic Complexity (`O(N^2)`)**  
     Often works well when `N` is up to 1,000. Common for problems involving nested loops, such as checking pairs, matrix operations, or simpler dynamic programming problems.

   - **`O(N log N)` Complexity**  
     Works when `N` is up to 10⁵ or 10⁶. This includes sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort) and efficient data structure operations (e.g., balanced trees, heaps, binary search).

   - **Linear Complexity (`O(N)`)**  
     Often required for constraints near `10⁶` or `10⁷`. Problems involving single traversals, counting, or prefix sums fit here.

   - **Logarithmic or Constant Complexity (`O(log N)` or `O(1)`)**  
     Required for very large `N` (e.g., `N > 10^8`). Suitable for operations like binary search, bit manipulations, or using direct mathematical formulas.

### 4. **Analyzing Constraint Combinations**
   - If there are multiple parameters, consider the combined complexity. For example, if both `N` and `M` (two dimensions) are given as `10⁴`, then an `O(N * M)` approach may be feasible, as it results in approximately `10⁸` operations.

### 5. **Recognizing Patterns in Constraints**
   - **Subarray or Subsequence problems** often require `O(N)` or `O(N^2)`.
   - **Graph problems** with nodes and edges (`V` and `E`) use complexities based on `V + E` for BFS/DFS or `V^2` for dense graph algorithms.
   - **String matching or processing** may require `O(N)` or `O(N log N)` based on `N`.

### Example Walkthrough

**Example Constraint**: `N ≤ 100,000`
   - Aim for `O(N log N)` or lower.
   - Suitable algorithms: Sorting, binary search, single-pass algorithms, and efficient data structures like heaps or balanced trees.

**Example Constraint**: `N ≤ 1,000`
   - `O(N^2)` algorithms like Floyd-Warshall for graphs or dynamic programming on grids are feasible.

By understanding these general mappings between `N` and feasible time complexities, you can better estimate the appropriate approach for each coding problem.
