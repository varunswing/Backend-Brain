Designing a **Car Maintenance Workshop Management Portal** involves tracking users, vehicles, services, appointments, mechanics, parts, billing, and notifications — similar to a simplified ERP system for a garage or dealership.

## ✅ 1. Functional Requirements

### Customer Side:

* Register/login as a customer
* Register one or more vehicles
* Book a service appointment (select date, time, service type)
* View service history, bills, service status

### Admin/Workshop Side:

* Add/edit/delete mechanics
* View appointment calendar
* Assign mechanics to service jobs
* Track job status: pending, in-progress, completed
* Manage spare parts inventory
* Generate and view bills/invoices

## ✅ 2. Non-Functional Requirements

| NFR            | Details                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalable**   | Handle multiple garages, vehicles, and services |
| **Secure**     | Role-based access (admin, mechanic, customer)   |
| **Reliable**   | Don’t lose appointments or service data         |
| **Fast**       | Booking should be real-time, < 1s               |
| **Observable** | Logs for each job, error alerts, etc.           |

## ✅ 3. Entities & DB Schema

### Tables:

#### `Users` (Customers, Mechanics, Admin)

```sql
id UUID PK,
name TEXT,
email TEXT UNIQUE,
phone TEXT,
role ENUM('CUSTOMER', 'MECHANIC', 'ADMIN'),
password_hash TEXT
```

#### `Vehicles`

```sql
id UUID PK,
user_id UUID FK -> Users(id),
plate_number TEXT UNIQUE,
brand TEXT,
model TEXT,
year INT
```

#### `Appointments`

```sql
id UUID PK,
user_id UUID,
vehicle_id UUID,
appointment_time TIMESTAMP,
status ENUM('PENDING', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED')
```

#### `ServiceJobs`

```sql
id UUID PK,
appointment_id UUID FK,
mechanic_id UUID FK,
job_type TEXT,   -- e.g., Oil Change, Engine Check
status ENUM,
start_time TIMESTAMP,
end_time TIMESTAMP
```

#### `PartsInventory`

```sql
id UUID PK,
name TEXT,
quantity INT,
unit_price DECIMAL
```

#### `Bills`

```sql
id UUID PK,
appointment_id UUID,
total_amount DECIMAL,
generated_at TIMESTAMP,
paid BOOLEAN
```

## ✅ 4. UML Class Diagram (Simplified)

```
User ──┬────── owns ────> Vehicle
       │
       └──── books ────> Appointment ─────> ServiceJob ─── assigned_to ──> Mechanic (User)
                                     │
                                     └────── generates ──> Bill
```

---

## ✅ 5. API Endpoints (Major Flows)

### Customer

* **POST /register**
* **POST /login**
* **POST /vehicles** → add vehicle
* **POST /appointments** → book service
* **GET /appointments/{id}/status**

### Workshop/Admin

* **GET /appointments/today**
* **POST /appointments/{id}/assign?mechanicId=xxx**
* **POST /service-jobs/{id}/start**
* **POST /service-jobs/{id}/end**
* **POST /inventory/parts**
* **POST /bills/generate?appointmentId=xxx**

## ✅ 6. Service Classes and Key Functions

```java
class AppointmentService {
    public UUID bookAppointment(UUID userId, UUID vehicleId, LocalDateTime time) { ... }
    public void cancelAppointment(UUID appointmentId) { ... }
    public AppointmentStatus getStatus(UUID appointmentId) { ... }
}
```

```java
class ServiceJobService {
    public void assignMechanic(UUID jobId, UUID mechanicId) { ... }
    public void startJob(UUID jobId) { ... }
    public void endJob(UUID jobId) { ... }
}
```

```java
class BillingService {
    public Bill generateBill(UUID appointmentId) { ... }
    public void markPaid(UUID billId) { ... }
}
```

## ✅ 7. Design Patterns Used

| Pattern             | Use                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Factory**         | Create different job types dynamically    |
| **Observer**        | Notify users when service status changes  |
| **Strategy**        | Pricing based on vehicle type/service     |
| **Template Method** | Job workflow for various services         |
| **Command Pattern** | For triggering bill generation, job steps |

---

## ✅ 8. Concurrency Handling

* Lock slots for appointment scheduling (pessimistic/optimistic locking)
* Prevent double mechanic assignment (transactional check)
* Lock inventory rows when updating part quantities

---

## ✅ 9. Fault Tolerance

* Retry on notification/send failure
* Background jobs for report/bill generation
* Idempotent APIs for booking, billing
* Dead-letter queues for async notifications

---

## ✅ 10. Observability

| Metric                      | Description           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Average appointment time    | For performance       |
| Completed jobs per mechanic | Productivity tracking |
| Inventory low alerts        | Parts management      |
| Error rates                 | API and system health |
| Notifications sent          | Auditing and alerting |

## ✅ 11. Cross Questions Interviewer Might Ask

| Topic               | Question                                                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Booking             | How do you prevent double bookings for the same slot?           |
| Mechanic Assignment | How would you auto-assign based on load or skills?              |
| Inventory           | How to track real-time availability of parts across branches?   |
| Billing             | What happens if part prices change mid-service?                 |
| Security            | How do you prevent unauthorized users from updating job status? |
| Performance         | How to handle 1000 appointments/hour?                           |
| Failures            | What if a mechanic leaves mid-job?                              |
| Notifications       | How are customers alerted about job status?                     |
