**Cluster-Specific Database Configurations**:
Based on the attached configurations, I implemented separate database configurations for each banking cluster:

```java
// C1 Cluster Configuration (Bank 1)
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "archival.switchV2.c1.slave.datasource")
ArchivalSwitchV2C1SlaveDBConfig with dedicated HikariCP pool

// C2 Cluster Configuration (Bank 2) 
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "archival.switchV2.c2.slave.datasource")
ArchivalSwitchV2C2SlaveDBConfig with optimized connection management

// Future scalable approach (supports N banks)
@Component
public class DynamicBankingClusterManager {
    
    @Autowired
    private PartnerConfigurationService partnerConfigService;
    
    @PostConstruct
    public void initializeBankingClusters() {
        List<BankingPartner> partners = partnerConfigService.getAllActivePartners();
        
        for (BankingPartner partner : partners) {
            createDynamicDataSource(partner);
            configureClusterRouting(partner);
            setupMonitoring(partner);
