## 2. STAR Format Response (Theory-Heavy)

### Situation

The UPI Refund Service was experiencing significant technical debt due to tight coupling with the shared `upi-commons` repository. This architectural dependency created a cascading failure risk across multiple services and severely impacted deployment agility. The refund service needed to fetch transaction data from archived databases across multiple clusters (C1, C2, C3, C6) as transactions older than 40 days were moved from active switch databases to archival databases by the UPI Archiver Service.

**Complex System Architecture**:
- **UPI Archiver Service**: Automated data lifecycle management with configurable purge policies (15-40 days retention) moving txn_info and txn_participants tables from master databases to cluster-specific archive databases. The archiver runs on cron schedules with batch processing (5-150 records per batch) and includes safety mechanisms like hard-stop times and worker thread pools (5-40 threads)
- **UPI Switch Service**: Main transaction processing engine with hybrid data access modes (DB, AEROSPIKE, DB_AEROSPIKE_AUDIT) supporting multiple database clusters with master-slave replication, backup slave configurations, and ProxySQL for connection pooling
- **UPI Refund Service**: Refund processing system requiring queries across both active and archived transaction data from multiple database clusters, supporting both online and offline refund processing with complex business validation rules

**Infrastructure Constraints**:
- Paytm's legacy infrastructure consisted of 6 pods, each handling 15-20% of total traffic
- No canary deployment capability for gradual rollout
- High-risk deployment environment with potential for customer impact
- Shared repository dependencies affecting multiple critical services simultaneously

**Business Impact Context**:
- Processing over ₹15,000 crores annually in refunds
- 50,000+ daily refund transactions across multiple banking partners
- Zero tolerance for downtime due to financial transaction criticality
- Regulatory compliance requirements for transaction data retention and audit trails

### Task

**Primary Objective**: Decouple the UPI Refund Service from the shared `upi-commons` repository to eliminate technical debt, improve system maintainability, and enable independent service deployments.

**Secondary Objectives**:
- Implement modular, standalone components using Factory and Builder patterns for better object creation and assembly
- Establish robust unit and integration testing frameworks for the new architecture
- Leverage the banking partner migration as a strategic deployment opportunity with minimal risk
- Design comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and rollback mechanisms for production safety

**Technical Scope**:
- **Dependency Decoupling**: Remove all references to shared `upi-commons` repository affecting 15+ service components

**Factory Pattern Implementation**:
```java
// Strategic Factory Design for Service Abstraction
@Component
public class TxnServiceFactory {
    private EnumMap<Enums.TXN_TYPE, ExternalTxnService> serviceMap;
    
    @PostConstruct
    private void initializeServices() {
        // Runtime service discovery and registration
        Map<String, ExternalTxnService> discoveredServices = 
            applicationContext.getBeansOfType(ExternalTxnService.class);
        
        // O(1) lookup performance with type-safe enum mapping
        serviceMap = new EnumMap<>(Enums.TXN_TYPE.class);
        discoveredServices.forEach((name, service) -> 
            serviceMap.put(service.getType(), service));
    }
    
    public ExternalTxnService getService(Enums.TXN_TYPE type) {
        return serviceMap.get(type); // Thread-safe O(1) access
    }
}
```

**Builder Pattern Application**:
```java
// Complex Object Assembly with Validation
public class RefundInfoBuilder {
    private RefundInfo refundInfo = new RefundInfo();
    
    public RefundInfoBuilder withTransactionDetails(String txnId, BigDecimal amount) {
        this.refundInfo.setTxnId(txnId);
        this.refundInfo.setRefundAmount(amount);
        return this;
    }
    
    public RefundInfoBuilder withExtendedInfo(String callbackUrl, String note) {
        Map<String, String> extendedInfoMap = new HashMap<>();
        extendedInfoMap.put("callbackUrl", callbackUrl);
        extendedInfoMap.put("note", note);
        this.refundInfo.setExtendedInfo(JsonUtils.getJson(extendedInfoMap));
        return this;
    }
    
    public RefundInfo build() {
        validateRefundInfo(refundInfo); // Business rule validation
        return refundInfo; // Immutable object creation

    // Priority-based cluster querying with validation
    for (String cluster : Arrays.asList("C1", "C2", "C3", "C6")) {
        if (isClusterEnabled(cluster)) {
            try {
                participants = queryCluster(cluster, txnInfo.getTxnId());
                if (validateParticipants(participants, txnInfo)) {
                    activeCluster = cluster;
                    break; // Stop on first valid result
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                logClusterError(cluster, e);
                // Continue to next cluster

        return ValidationResult.failure("Participant count mismatch");
    }
    
    // Business validations
    BigDecimal totalAmount = participants.stream()
        .map(ArchivalTxnParticipants::getAmount)
        .reduce(BigDecimal.ZERO, BigDecimal::add);
    
    if (!totalAmount.equals(txnInfo.getAmount())) {
        return ValidationResult.failure("Amount reconciliation failed");
    }
    
    // Temporal validations
    participants.forEach(p -> {
        if (p.getCreatedOn().after(txnInfo.getCreatedOn().plus(Duration.ofHours(1)))) {
