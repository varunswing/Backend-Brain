**Situation**: 
As an oncall engineer at both Paytm and MakeMyTrip, I was responsible for monitoring and resolving real-time issues across complex microservices architectures. At Paytm, I supported the UPI ecosystem processing ₹50,000+ crores monthly through services like upi-switch, upi-refund, upi-consumers, upi-jobs, upi-recon, and upi-lite. At MakeMyTrip, I managed travel services including inventory, pricing, reservation engines, and orchestration systems. Both environments featured high-traffic, mission-critical systems with zero-tolerance for downtime.

**Task**: 
My responsibilities included: (1) Triaging and categorizing incoming alerts from Grafana dashboards and monitoring systems, (2) Performing root cause analysis across distributed systems using logs, metrics, and database queries, (3) Collaborating with service owners and cross-functional teams for complex issue resolution, (4) Escalating infrastructure issues to DevOps teams when system-level interventions were required, (5) Documenting incident patterns and contributing to system reliability improvements.

**Action**: 

*Systematic Monitoring and Alert Response*:
- Implemented structured triage processes using Grafana dashboards to monitor service health metrics, Kafka consumer lag indicators, database query performance, and business transaction success rates
- Developed expertise in correlating alerts across multiple monitoring systems to identify cascading failures versus isolated incidents
- Created systematic approaches for distinguishing between application-level issues requiring code investigation versus infrastructure problems needing DevOps escalation

*Cross-Service Debugging and Analysis*:
- Built comprehensive understanding of service interdependencies by analyzing transaction flows across UPI switch → refund → reconciliation pipelines and travel booking → inventory → pricing → payment workflows
- Developed skills in database query optimization and troubleshooting across multiple MySQL clusters, understanding master-slave configurations and connection pool management
- Mastered log analysis techniques using ELK stack and Kibana to trace transaction paths and identify failure points in complex distributed systems

*Collaborative Problem-Solving*:
- Established effective communication patterns with service owners, utilizing their domain expertise while contributing my cross-service knowledge to accelerate problem resolution
- Developed ability to quickly understand unfamiliar codebases and business logic through strategic code exploration and service owner collaboration
- Created systematic approaches for knowledge transfer, documenting common patterns and solutions for future oncall engineers

**Result**: 
This oncall experience significantly enhanced my technical depth and breadth, giving me comprehensive understanding of distributed systems, monitoring strategies, and incident response methodologies. I developed expertise in troubleshooting complex issues spanning multiple services, databases, and infrastructure components. The experience improved my ability to work under pressure, communicate effectively with diverse technical teams, and think systematically about complex system interactions. This foundation proved invaluable for understanding large-scale system design, reliability engineering principles, and cross-functional collaboration in high-stakes environments.

## 3. Comprehensive Interview Questions & Theoretical Answers

**Q1: How did you approach troubleshooting issues when you weren't familiar with a particular service?**

**A:** I developed a systematic approach starting with understanding the service's position in the overall architecture. I'd examine monitoring dashboards to understand normal vs. abnormal patterns, review recent deployment logs, and analyze error patterns in application logs. I'd quickly identify the service owner and collaborate with them, asking targeted questions about recent changes, dependencies, and known issues. I'd also examine configuration files and database connections to understand external dependencies. This approach allowed me to contribute meaningful insights even for unfamiliar services while learning the system architecture.

**Q2: Describe a complex multi-service issue you encountered and how you diagnosed it.**

**A:** I encountered issues where UPI transaction failures appeared to originate in the switch service but were actually caused by downstream CBS (Core Banking System) connectivity problems. I learned to trace transaction flows systematically: checking switch logs for transaction initiation, examining CBS adapter logs for communication patterns, analyzing database connection pool metrics, and correlating with infrastructure alerts. This taught me to think in terms of data flow and dependencies rather than isolated service failures.

**Q3: How did you handle Kafka consumer lag issues?**

**A:** Kafka lag required understanding both the consumer service architecture and message processing patterns. I'd analyze lag metrics across different consumer groups, examine processing time trends, and investigate whether lag was due to high message volume, slow processing logic, or infrastructure issues. Solutions ranged from scaling consumer instances, optimizing message processing logic, to identifying and resolving database bottlenecks. I learned to differentiate between temporary spikes versus systemic performance issues.

**Q4: What strategies did you use to quickly understand system architecture during incidents?**

**A:** I developed techniques for rapid architecture comprehension including examining service configuration files to understand dependencies, reviewing database connection strings to map data flow, analyzing log patterns to understand service interactions, and leveraging monitoring dashboards to visualize system health. I'd also maintain mental models of common architectural patterns like API gateways, message queues, and database clustering to quickly orient myself in new systems.

**Q5: How did you collaborate with teams when escalating issues?**

**A:** Effective escalation required providing comprehensive context including clear problem description with business impact, relevant log excerpts and error messages, steps already taken for diagnosis, suspected root causes with supporting evidence, and specific requests for assistance. I learned to frame issues in terms of business impact rather than technical symptoms, which helped prioritize response and get appropriate resources allocated.

**Q6: What monitoring and observability patterns did you learn to rely on?**

**A:** I learned to use layered monitoring approaches including infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, network), application metrics (response times, error rates, throughput), business metrics (transaction success rates, user impact), and log analysis for detailed debugging. Key patterns included establishing baseline behaviors, setting up correlation dashboards to see system-wide impacts, and creating alert hierarchies to distinguish critical from informational notifications.

**Q7: How did you handle pressure during critical production issues?**

**A:** I developed structured approaches including immediate impact assessment and communication to stakeholders, systematic diagnosis following established runbooks, regular status updates to prevent escalation anxiety, and post-incident documentation for future reference. The key was maintaining clear thinking under pressure by following established processes and leveraging team expertise rather than trying to solve everything independently.

**Q8: What database troubleshooting techniques did you develop?**

**A:** I learned to analyze connection pool metrics, query performance patterns, and master-slave replication lag. Common issues included connection pool exhaustion, slow queries causing cascading delays, and database failover scenarios. I developed skills in reading query execution plans, understanding index utilization, and recognizing patterns indicating infrastructure versus application-level database issues.

**Q9: How did you stay updated on system changes that might affect oncall scenarios?**

**A:** I established processes for monitoring deployment notifications, reviewing change logs, attending service owner standups when possible, and maintaining communication channels with infrastructure teams. I learned that staying informed about planned changes significantly improved incident response effectiveness by providing context for unusual behaviors.

**Q10: What lessons did you learn about system design from oncall experience?**

**A:** Oncall taught me the importance of observability by design, including comprehensive logging, meaningful metrics, and clear service boundaries. I learned that systems should be designed for debuggability, with clear error messages, traceable request flows, and accessible diagnostic tools. The experience highlighted the value of circuit breakers, graceful degradation, and bulkhead patterns for preventing cascading failures.

**Q11: How did you handle learning multiple technology stacks simultaneously?**

**A:** I focused on understanding common patterns across technologies rather than memorizing specific details. For example, understanding message queue concepts applied whether working with Kafka, RabbitMQ, or other systems. I prioritized learning debugging methodologies and observability patterns that transferred across different technology stacks, which made adapting to new systems more efficient.

**Q12: What was your approach to documenting and sharing oncall knowledge?**

**A:** I maintained runbooks with common issue patterns and resolution steps, created architecture diagrams for complex systems, documented service owner contacts and escalation procedures, and shared post-incident learnings with the broader team. This knowledge sharing improved overall team effectiveness and reduced resolution times for common issues.
