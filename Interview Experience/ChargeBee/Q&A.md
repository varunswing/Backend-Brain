# Que 1. Spring MVC vs SpringBoot

**Spring MVC** and **Spring Boot** are both components of the larger **Spring Framework**, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here's a comparison to help clarify their differences and use cases:

---

### **Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller)**
- **Purpose**: A framework for building web applications using the MVC design pattern.
- **Features**:
  - Separates application logic (Controller) from the user interface (View) and the data (Model).
  - Handles HTTP requests and responses, routing them to the appropriate controller methods.
  - Supports RESTful services and traditional web applications.
  - Provides fine-grained control over configuration.
- **Requires Manual Setup**:
  - Dependency configuration, XML or Java-based configurations, and WAR file deployments.
  - Requires a container like Tomcat, Jetty, or another servlet engine.
- **Use Case**:
  - Ideal when you want more control over the application's setup and configuration.
  - Suitable for legacy projects that rely heavily on traditional Spring XML configurations.

---

### **Spring Boot**
- **Purpose**: A framework that simplifies the development of Spring-based applications by providing defaults and reducing boilerplate code.
- **Features**:
  - Built on top of the Spring Framework, including Spring MVC.
  - Provides **auto-configuration** to automatically set up common Spring components based on dependencies.
  - Comes with an **embedded web server** (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty) for running standalone applications (no need for external deployment).
  - Uses **Spring Boot Starter dependencies** to simplify adding common features (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`).
  - Integrated support for modern features like Spring Security, Spring Data, and REST APIs.
- **Requires Minimal Setup**:
  - Uses convention over configuration, meaning defaults are provided but can be customized if needed.
  - Can package the application as a JAR and run it with a simple `java -jar` command.
- **Use Case**:
  - Perfect for microservices and modern web applications.
  - Suitable when you want to get started quickly with minimal boilerplate code.
  - Ideal for projects where rapid prototyping and development are key.

---

### **Key Differences**

| Feature                     | Spring MVC                       | Spring Boot                     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**             | Requires more manual setup       | Simplifies setup and configuration with auto-configuration |
| **Application Type**        | Traditional web applications     | Microservices and standalone apps |
| **Deployment**              | WAR file on external server      | Standalone with embedded server (e.g., JAR) |
| **Configuration**           | XML or Java-based configuration  | Convention over configuration; auto-configuration |
| **Startup Time**            | Longer due to manual setup       | Faster due to defaults and auto-configuration |
| **Embedded Server**         | Not included by default          | Included (Tomcat, Jetty, or others) |
| **Use Case**                | Legacy or highly customized apps | Rapid development and modern apps |

---

### **When to Use Which?**
1. **Spring MVC**:  
   - When working on a legacy system or integrating with existing Spring projects.  
   - If you need precise control over configurations.  

2. **Spring Boot**:  
   - For modern applications that need rapid development and deployment.  
   - If you're building microservices or cloud-native applications.  
   - When simplicity and ease of use are priorities.  

---

Both frameworks are complementary. Spring Boot internally uses Spring MVC for web applications, so itâ€™s not an either-or choice; Spring Boot is often the preferred option unless there's a specific need for a traditional Spring MVC setup.

# Que 2. What are Beans

In the **Spring Framework**, a **bean** is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. Beans are the backbone of a Spring application and are used to define and manage the objects that make up your application. 

### **Key Features of Beans**
1. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - The IoC container controls the lifecycle of beans, from instantiation to destruction.
   - Beans can have lifecycle callbacks for initialization and cleanup.

2. **Dependency Injection (DI)**:
   - Beans can be wired together via DI, where the container injects dependencies into beans automatically.

3. **Singleton by Default**:
   - By default, Spring beans are singleton-scoped, meaning the container creates and maintains a single instance of the bean.

4. **Customization**:
   - Bean definitions can include configuration for properties, scope, initialization, destruction methods, and more.

---

### **Defining Beans**
Beans can be defined in multiple ways in Spring:

#### 1. **XML Configuration**:
```xml
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyClass"/>
```

#### 2. **Java-Based Configuration** (using `@Configuration` and `@Bean` annotations):
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyClass myBean() {
        return new MyClass();
    }
}
```

#### 3. **Component Scanning with Annotations**:
Spring can automatically detect and register beans using annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, or `@Controller`.
```java
@Component
public class MyClass {
    // Bean definition
}
```

---

### **Bean Scopes**
Spring beans can have different scopes that define how and when they are created:

1. **Singleton (Default)**:
   - One instance per Spring IoC container.
   - Example: Service or DAO components.

2. **Prototype**:
   - A new instance is created every time the bean is requested.
   - Example: Stateful objects.

3. **Request**:
   - One instance per HTTP request (web applications only).

4. **Session**:
   - One instance per HTTP session (web applications only).

5. **Global Session**:
   - One instance per global HTTP session (portlet-based web apps).

---

### **Bean Lifecycle**
1. **Instantiation**: The IoC container instantiates the bean.
2. **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are injected.
3. **Custom Initialization**: `@PostConstruct` or a custom init method is called.
4. **Usage**: The bean is ready for use.
5. **Destruction**: `@PreDestroy` or a custom destroy method is called before the bean is removed from the container.

---

### **Examples of Usage**
1. **Service Layer**:
   Beans are used to define service components that encapsulate business logic:
   ```java
   @Service
   public class UserService {
       public String getUserName() {
           return "John Doe";
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Data Access Layer**:
   Beans often represent repositories or DAOs for data access:
   ```java
   @Repository
   public class UserRepository {
       public User findUserById(int id) {
           return new User(id, "John Doe");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Controller Layer**:
   Beans can also be used as controllers in Spring MVC:
   ```java
   @Controller
   public class UserController {
       @Autowired
       private UserService userService;
   }
   ```

---

### **Why Beans are Important**
- Central to Dependency Injection.
- Help in decoupling application components.
- Allow the Spring container to manage object lifecycle and dependencies.
- Support modular and reusable design. 

In essence, a Spring bean is any object that is managed by the Spring container. They help in building scalable, testable, and maintainable applications.

# Que 3. @SpringBootApplications

The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a central and commonly used annotation in Spring Boot applications. It simplifies the configuration process by combining several annotations into one and enables various Spring Boot features.

---

### **What Does `@SpringBootApplication` Do?**

`@SpringBootApplication` is a combination of the following annotations:

1. **`@SpringBootConfiguration`**:
   - Indicates that the class is a configuration class (like `@Configuration`).
   - Used to define beans and dependency injections within the application context.

2. **`@EnableAutoConfiguration`**:
   - Tells Spring Boot to enable its auto-configuration mechanism.
   - Automatically configures your application based on the dependencies added to your project (e.g., configuring a web server if `spring-boot-starter-web` is included).
   - Reduces boilerplate configuration.

3. **`@ComponentScan`**:
   - Enables component scanning, so Spring can discover and register beans (e.g., classes annotated with `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, or `@Controller`) in the package where the application class resides and its sub-packages.

---

### **Example Usage**
The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is typically placed on the main class of a Spring Boot application:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### **Key Features Enabled by `@SpringBootApplication`**
1. **Auto-Configuration**:
   - Configures components like a web server, database connections, and messaging queues automatically, depending on the dependencies on the classpath.

2. **Component Scanning**:
   - Automatically registers beans within the package of the annotated class and its sub-packages.

3. **Single Entry Point**:
   - Provides a single entry point for the application using the `main` method.

4. **Reduced Boilerplate**:
   - Eliminates the need for manually declaring configuration classes, enabling auto-configuration and component scanning explicitly.

---

### **Customization**
You can customize the behavior of `@SpringBootApplication` by overriding its components:

#### Exclude Certain Auto-Configurations:
If you want to exclude specific auto-configurations:
```java
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
public class MyApplication {
}
```

#### Customize Component Scan:
If your beans are outside the default scanning package:
```java
@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.custompackage")
public class MyApplication {
}
```

---

### **Benefits**
1. Simplifies application setup by reducing configuration code.
2. Automatically adapts to your application's needs based on the dependencies.
3. Encourages a convention-over-configuration approach.

`@SpringBootApplication` is a convenient shorthand for configuring a Spring Boot application and is essential for quick development and deployment of modern Java applications.

# Que 4. @AutoConfiguration

In Spring, **auto-configuration** refers to the process of setting up beans and application configurations automatically based on the application's classpath and properties. While Spring Boot enables auto-configuration by default, you can also create custom auto-configurations for your own modules or applications. Here's how to do it:

---

### **1. How Spring Boot Auto-Configuration Works**
Spring Boot uses the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation (which is part of `@SpringBootApplication`) to:
- Scan the classpath for specific libraries (e.g., `spring-web`, `spring-data-jpa`).
- Enable configurations by loading predefined classes marked with `@Configuration`.
- Use `META-INF/spring.factories` to locate auto-configuration classes.

---

### **2. Steps to Create Custom Auto-Configuration**

#### **Step 1: Create a Configuration Class**
Define a class annotated with `@Configuration` that contains the logic for setting up beans.

```java
@Configuration
public class MyAutoConfiguration {
    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}
```

#### **Step 2: Use Conditional Annotations**
To ensure that your configuration is applied only when certain conditions are met, use conditional annotations like:
- `@ConditionalOnClass`: Checks if a class is present on the classpath.
- `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`: Configures a bean only if itâ€™s not already defined.
- `@ConditionalOnProperty`: Configures a bean based on a property in the `application.properties` file.

```java
@Configuration
@ConditionalOnClass(name = "com.example.MyDependency")
public class MyAutoConfiguration {
    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnMissingBean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}
```

#### **Step 3: Register Your Auto-Configuration in `spring.factories`**
Create a `META-INF/spring.factories` file in your project. This file tells Spring Boot about your custom auto-configuration.

```properties
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration=\
com.example.config.MyAutoConfiguration
```

Spring Boot will now pick up this configuration during startup if the conditions are met.

---

### **3. Example of Auto-Configuration in Practice**

#### **1. Custom Auto-Configuration Class**
```java
@Configuration
@ConditionalOnClass(DataSource.class)
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "custom.datasource.enabled", havingValue = "true", matchIfMissing = true)
public class DataSourceAutoConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public DataSource customDataSource() {
        // Create and return a custom DataSource
        return new HikariDataSource();
    }
}
```

#### **2. Register in `spring.factories`**
```properties
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration=\
com.example.config.DataSourceAutoConfiguration
```

#### **3. Activate with `application.properties`**
```properties
custom.datasource.enabled=true
```

---

### **4. How to Disable Auto-Configuration**
You can disable specific auto-configurations by using the `exclude` attribute in `@SpringBootApplication` or `@EnableAutoConfiguration`.

```java
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class)
public class MyApplication {
}
```

Or using `application.properties`:
```properties
spring.autoconfigure.exclude=org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceAutoConfiguration
```

---

### **5. Common Annotations for Auto-Configuration**
- `@ConditionalOnClass`: Apply configuration only if a class is available on the classpath.
- `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`: Apply configuration only if a specific bean is not already defined.
- `@ConditionalOnBean`: Apply configuration only if a specific bean exists.
- `@ConditionalOnProperty`: Enable/disable configuration based on properties.
- `@ConditionalOnResource`: Check for the presence of a resource (e.g., file or configuration).
- `@ConditionalOnWebApplication`: Apply configuration only for web applications.

---

### **Benefits of Auto-Configuration**
1. **Simplifies Development**: Developers don't need to manually define common configurations.
2. **Customizable**: Supports conditional configuration and properties-based customization.
3. **Extensible**: You can create custom auto-configurations for reusable modules.

By following these steps, you can leverage Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism and create modular, reusable, and flexible application configurations.

# Que 5. How to initialize a bean in springboot.

In Spring, initializing a bean refers to the process of creating an instance of a class, setting its properties, and performing any custom initialization logic. Spring provides several ways to initialize beans. Here's a breakdown of how to do it:

---

### **1. Using `@Bean` in Java Configuration**
The `@Bean` annotation defines a bean in a `@Configuration` class. 

#### Example:
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}
```
- **How it works**: Spring calls the `myService` method and registers its return value as a bean in the application context.
- **Customization**: Add initialization logic inside the `myService` method or by defining initialization methods (see below).

---

### **2. Using `@Component` and Stereotype Annotations**
Classes annotated with `@Component` (or its specializations like `@Service`, `@Repository`, or `@Controller`) are automatically detected during classpath scanning.

#### Example:
```java
@Component
public class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {
    public MyServiceImpl() {
        System.out.println("MyService bean initialized");
    }
}
```
- **How it works**: Spring scans the classpath for `@Component` annotations and registers the class as a bean in the application context.

---

### **3. Using XML Configuration (Legacy Approach)**
You can declare beans in an XML configuration file.

#### Example:
```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans">
    <bean id="myService" class="com.example.MyServiceImpl"/>
</beans>
```
- **How it works**: The `bean` tag defines a bean with an ID and the fully qualified class name.

---

### **4. Using `@PostConstruct` for Initialization**
The `@PostConstruct` annotation can be added to a method that should run after the bean is fully initialized.

#### Example:
```java
@Component
public class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {
    
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("MyService initialized with custom logic");
    }
}
```
- **How it works**: Spring calls the `init` method after dependency injection is complete.

---

### **5. Using Custom Initialization Method**
You can specify a custom initialization method in two ways:

#### a) **With `@Bean(initMethod)`**
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean(initMethod = "init")
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}
```

#### b) **With `XML`**
```xml
<bean id="myService" class="com.example.MyServiceImpl" init-method="init"/>
```

#### Example Custom Initialization Method:
```java
public class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("Custom initialization logic executed");
    }
}
```

---

### **6. Using the `InitializingBean` Interface**
Implement the `InitializingBean` interface and override the `afterPropertiesSet` method for initialization logic.

#### Example:
```java
@Component
public class MyServiceImpl implements MyService, InitializingBean {
    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() {
        System.out.println("InitializingBean: afterPropertiesSet called");
    }
}
```

---

### **7. Using Constructor for Initialization**
You can initialize a bean by placing logic in the constructor.

#### Example:
```java
@Component
public class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {
    public MyServiceImpl() {
        System.out.println("Bean initialized in constructor");
    }
}
```
- **How it works**: Spring calls the constructor when creating the bean instance.

---

### **8. Combining Initialization Techniques**
You can combine multiple initialization techniques, such as using `@PostConstruct` for lightweight initialization logic and `@Bean(initMethod)` for heavy initialization tasks.

---

### **Order of Bean Initialization**
1. Constructor or static block (if any).
2. Dependency injection (fields or setters).
3. `@PostConstruct` method (if annotated).
4. `afterPropertiesSet` (if `InitializingBean` is implemented).
5. Custom `init-method` (if configured).

---

### **Example Combining Techniques**
```java
@Component
public class MyServiceImpl implements MyService, InitializingBean {

    public MyServiceImpl() {
        System.out.println("Constructor: Bean is being created");
    }

    @PostConstruct
    public void postConstruct() {
        System.out.println("@PostConstruct: Initialization logic");
    }

    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() {
        System.out.println("afterPropertiesSet: Initialization logic");
    }

    public void customInit() {
        System.out.println("Custom init-method: Initialization logic");
    }
}
```

With configuration:
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean(initMethod = "customInit")
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}
```

---

### **Best Practices**
- Use `@PostConstruct` for lightweight initialization tasks.
- Use `@Bean(initMethod)` for more complex or reusable beans.
- Avoid mixing too many initialization methods unless necessary.
- Prefer annotations over XML for modern Spring applications.

# Que 6. Different ways of Dependency Injection (DI) in spring boot

In Spring, **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a technique where the framework injects dependencies (objects or services) into a class instead of the class creating them. This promotes loose coupling and makes applications easier to test and maintain. Spring supports three primary ways to perform DI:

---

### **1. Constructor-Based Dependency Injection**
Here, dependencies are provided through the class constructor. It is the preferred approach, as it allows for immutable fields and ensures that the object is fully initialized when created.

#### Example:
```java
@Service
public class StudentService {

    private final StudentRepository studentRepository;

    // Constructor injection
    @Autowired
    public StudentService(StudentRepository studentRepository) {
        this.studentRepository = studentRepository;
    }

    public void saveStudent(Student student) {
        studentRepository.save(student);
    }
}
```

#### Key Points:
- The `@Autowired` annotation is optional for single-constructor classes in Spring (starting from Spring 4.3).
- Fields can be declared `final`, ensuring they cannot be changed after construction.

---

### **2. Setter-Based Dependency Injection**
Dependencies are injected through setter methods. This is useful for optional dependencies or when dependencies might need to be reconfigured.

#### Example:
```java
@Service
public class StudentService {

    private StudentRepository studentRepository;

    // Setter injection
    @Autowired
    public void setStudentRepository(StudentRepository studentRepository) {
        this.studentRepository = studentRepository;
    }

    public void saveStudent(Student student) {
        studentRepository.save(student);
    }
}
```

#### Key Points:
- The `@Autowired` annotation is required on the setter method.
- Useful for optional dependencies or beans that might need to be replaced after initialization.

---

### **3. Field-Based Dependency Injection**
Dependencies are injected directly into fields using the `@Autowired` annotation. This is the simplest way to inject dependencies but is generally discouraged for several reasons (see below).

#### Example:
```java
@Service
public class StudentService {

    @Autowired
    private StudentRepository studentRepository;

    public void saveStudent(Student student) {
        studentRepository.save(student);
    }
}
```

#### Key Points:
- No explicit constructors or setters are required.
- While concise, it tightly couples the class to the DI framework, making testing (via mocking) and reusability more challenging.

---

### **Comparing Dependency Injection Methods**
| Feature                    | Constructor Injection             | Setter Injection             | Field Injection             |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Preferred for**           | Mandatory dependencies            | Optional dependencies        | Quick setup for simple cases|
| **Immutability**            | Supports `final` fields           | No, fields can't be `final` | No, fields can't be `final` |
| **Testability**             | High, dependencies are explicit   | Medium, dependencies explicit | Low, dependencies are implicit|
| **Readability**             | Clear dependencies in constructor | Dependencies in setter       | Dependencies hidden         |
| **Recommended?**            | Yes (preferred approach)          | Yes (specific cases)         | No (discouraged)            |

---

### **4. Using `@Required` (Legacy)**
For setter-based DI, you can mark a dependency as mandatory with the `@Required` annotation. However, this is deprecated and not recommended in modern Spring applications.

```java
@Setter
@Required
public class StudentService {
    private StudentRepository studentRepository;
}
```

---

### **5. Qualifiers for Multiple Beans**
If there are multiple beans of the same type, use `@Qualifier` to specify which bean to inject.

#### Example:
```java
@Service
public class StudentService {

    private final StudentRepository studentRepository;

    @Autowired
    public StudentService(@Qualifier("primaryStudentRepository") StudentRepository studentRepository) {
        this.studentRepository = studentRepository;
    }
}
```

---

### **6. Dependency Injection in XML (Legacy)**
In XML-based configurations, dependencies can be injected using `<constructor-arg>` or `<property>`.

#### Constructor Injection:
```xml
<bean id="studentService" class="com.example.StudentService">
    <constructor-arg ref="studentRepository"/>
</bean>
```

#### Setter Injection:
```xml
<bean id="studentService" class="com.example.StudentService">
    <property name="studentRepository" ref="studentRepository"/>
</bean>
```

---

### **Best Practices**
1. **Use Constructor Injection**:
   - Ensures all required dependencies are available at construction.
   - Promotes immutability by allowing `final` fields.

2. **Use Setter Injection for Optional Dependencies**:
   - Suitable when a dependency may not always be required.

3. **Avoid Field Injection**:
   - While concise, it tightly couples the class to Spring, making unit testing harder.

4. **Use Annotations**:
   - Modern Spring applications should use annotations (`@Autowired`, `@Qualifier`, `@Component`, etc.) instead of XML.

By using these techniques wisely, you can write clean, maintainable, and testable Spring applications.

# Que 7. How creating an object and DI is different

In Spring, directly creating an object of a class like `StudentService` (e.g., using `new StudentService()`) doesn't work as expected in most scenarios because Spring won't manage this object. Here's why dependency injection (via `@Autowired`) or other Spring mechanisms is needed:

---

### **1. Spring and Dependency Injection Overview**
- **Spring Container**: Spring is a dependency injection framework. It manages the lifecycle of beans (objects) within its **ApplicationContext** or **IoC Container**.
- **Dependency Injection**: Spring injects the required dependencies (other beans) into a class automatically, removing the need for manual instantiation.

When you use `@Autowired`, Spring:
1. Creates an instance of the class (a bean) and manages its lifecycle.
2. Resolves and injects all its dependencies.
3. Handles additional features like aspect-oriented programming (AOP), transaction management, and proxy creation.

---

### **2. Why Direct Instantiation (`new`) Doesn't Work**
When you create an object manually, Spring can't manage it. Here's why:

#### a) **Not a Spring-Managed Bean**
Manually created objects are outside the Spring container. For example:
```java
public class SomeController {
    StudentService studentService = new StudentService(); // Manual instantiation
}
```
- The `studentService` instance is unmanaged. Spring won't:
  - Inject dependencies into it.
  - Apply additional features (like proxy-based features such as `@Transactional` or AOP).
  - Configure the object based on annotations or application properties.

---

#### b) **Dependencies Are Not Resolved**
When you use `new`, the `StudentService` dependencies (e.g., `StudentRepository`) won't be injected:
```java
@Service
public class StudentService {
    @Autowired
    private StudentRepository studentRepository;

    public void saveStudent(Student student) {
        studentRepository.save(student); // Throws NullPointerException
    }
}
```
- Manually created `StudentService` won't have `studentRepository` injected, leading to a `NullPointerException`.

---

#### c) **Lifecycle Methods Won't Be Called**
Spring-managed beans can use lifecycle methods (`@PostConstruct`, `InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet`, etc.) for initialization. These won't run if the object is created manually.

---

### **3. How Dependency Injection Solves This**
When you use Spring's Dependency Injection (e.g., `@Autowired`), the Spring container:
1. Scans for classes annotated with `@Service`, `@Component`, etc., and registers them as beans.
2. Automatically resolves dependencies and injects them where needed.
3. Ensures the entire application context is set up correctly.

#### Example with Dependency Injection:
```java
@RestController
public class StudentController {

    private final StudentService studentService;

    // Constructor-based Dependency Injection
    @Autowired
    public StudentController(StudentService studentService) {
        this.studentService = studentService;
    }

    @PostMapping("/students")
    public String registerStudent(@RequestBody Student student) {
        studentService.saveStudent(student); // Works because Spring injected studentService
        return "Student registered";
    }
}
```

---

### **4. When Can You Use `new`?**
You can manually instantiate objects **only** when:
1. The object doesn't rely on Spring-managed dependencies.
2. It doesn't need any lifecycle management by Spring.
3. You are certain you don't need any Spring features (like AOP, `@Transactional`, etc.).

Example:
```java
public class SimpleObject {
    public void printMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
Usage:
```java
SimpleObject obj = new SimpleObject();
obj.printMessage();
```

### **5. Why Spring Advocates for Dependency Injection**
- **Loose Coupling**: The class doesn't need to know how to create its dependencies.
- **Ease of Testing**: Mock dependencies can be injected in unit tests.
- **Consistent Management**: The container ensures all beans are initialized, injected, and configured properly.
- **Additional Features**: Features like proxying, AOP, transactions, and monitoring are seamlessly integrated.

---

### **Conclusion**
Manually creating objects (`new`) bypasses Spring's IoC container, leading to:
- Unresolved dependencies.
- Missing lifecycle callbacks.
- Absence of Spring-provided features like AOP and transactions.

Use **dependency injection** to leverage Spring's power and ensure your objects are fully functional and managed by the framework.

# Que 8. Why using new keyword is not dependency injection

No, **using the `new` keyword is not dependency injection**. It is manual instantiation, which is the opposite of dependency injection. Let me explain the difference in detail:

---

### **What is Dependency Injection?**
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where an object's dependencies are provided (injected) by an external system (in this case, the Spring framework). The object itself does not create its dependencies; instead, they are supplied by the **IoC (Inversion of Control)** container.

---

### **Key Characteristics of Dependency Injection**
1. The **Spring container** is responsible for creating and managing beans (objects).
2. Dependencies are resolved and injected by the framework using:
   - Constructor Injection
   - Setter Injection
   - Field Injection
3. The object does not need to know how to create its dependenciesâ€”it only declares what it needs.

#### Example of Dependency Injection:
```java
@Service
public class StudentService {

    private final StudentRepository studentRepository;

    // Constructor Injection
    public StudentService(StudentRepository studentRepository) {
        this.studentRepository = studentRepository;
    }

    public void saveStudent(Student student) {
        studentRepository.save(student);
    }
}
```
Here, Spring provides the `StudentRepository` dependency when creating the `StudentService` bean. The service doesn't instantiate the repository itself.

---

### **What Happens with `new`?**
When you use `new` to create an object, the dependency is not injected; instead, the class creates its dependency manually. This approach bypasses the Spring container, breaking the principle of dependency injection.

#### Example:
```java
public class StudentService {

    private StudentRepository studentRepository;

    public StudentService() {
        this.studentRepository = new StudentRepository(); // Manual instantiation
    }

    public void saveStudent(Student student) {
        studentRepository.save(student);
    }
}
```

#### Why This is Not Dependency Injection:
1. The `StudentService` creates its own `StudentRepository` dependency.
2. The object (`StudentRepository`) is not managed by Spring.
3. You lose the benefits of DI, such as testability, loose coupling, and lifecycle management.

---

### **Problems with Using `new` Instead of DI**
1. **Tight Coupling**:
   - The `StudentService` class is tightly coupled to the `StudentRepository` implementation. Changing the repository implementation requires modifying the service.

2. **No Testability**:
   - You can't easily inject a mock `StudentRepository` during testing.

3. **Misses Spring Features**:
   - Objects created with `new` won't benefit from Spring-managed features like:
     - Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
     - Transaction management (`@Transactional`)
     - Dependency resolution (`@Autowired`)

4. **No Lifecycle Management**:
   - Spring won't manage the lifecycle of the manually created object, so annotations like `@PostConstruct` or `@PreDestroy` won't work.

---

### **When is `new` Appropriate?**
Using `new` is valid in situations where:
1. The object does not have dependencies.
2. The object does not need to be managed by Spring.
3. You are certain that Spring-specific features (e.g., DI, AOP, lifecycle callbacks) are

# Que 9. What is issue with new keyword

Yes, using the `new` keyword in Spring instead of relying on **dependency injection (DI)** can lead to several issues, particularly when working with Spring-managed beans. Here are the key problems that may arise:

---

### **1. Dependencies Are Not Injected**
When you use the `new` keyword to create an object, the Spring container doesn't manage that object, so **dependencies won't be injected**.

#### Example:
```java
public class StudentService {

    private StudentRepository studentRepository;

    public StudentService() {
        this.studentRepository = new StudentRepository(); // Manual instantiation
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `StudentRepository` is manually instantiated, and it won't receive any injected dependencies (e.g., a database connection or any other dependencies). **Spring will not inject beans** like `@Autowired` dependencies into `studentRepository`.

### **2. Tight Coupling**
Manually creating objects using `new` introduces **tight coupling** between classes, which defeats one of the primary purposes of DI. The class now directly depends on the concrete implementation of the dependency, making it harder to change or test.

#### Example:
If `StudentService` is tightly coupled to `StudentRepository`, replacing `StudentRepository` with a different implementation would require modifying the service class. This is problematic, especially for large applications or when you need to swap implementations (e.g., switching from a database repository to a mock repository).

---

### **3. Missing Spring Features**
Spring offers additional features, like **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)**, **transaction management**, **lifecycle hooks**, and **event management**, which rely on Spring's control over object creation and management. Using `new` bypasses these features.

- **AOP**: If your class needs proxy-based features (e.g., `@Transactional` or logging), creating an object with `new` will not work, as Spring won't be able to wrap it in a proxy.
  
  For example, `@Transactional` would not work if you create a service with `new` because Spring can't proxy the method for transaction handling.

- **Lifecycle Callbacks**: Spring beans can use lifecycle annotations such as `@PostConstruct` or `@PreDestroy`. These methods won't be triggered if the object is created using `new` instead of by Spring.

---

### **4. No Integration with Spring's IoC Container**
Springâ€™s **Inversion of Control (IoC) Container** is responsible for managing the lifecycle of beans, including:
- Creation
- Initialization
- Dependency injection
- Destruction

When you use `new`, the object is not part of this container, so it doesn't benefit from Spring's lifecycle management. For example, `@PostConstruct` won't work, and Spring wonâ€™t manage the object's destruction or cleanup.

---

### **5. Difficult to Test**
Manual instantiation makes unit testing difficult. Spring enables **mocking** of beans using tools like `Mockito` and injecting mock dependencies for testing. With the `new` keyword, this becomes much harder, and you lose the ability to easily mock and inject dependencies in tests.

#### Example:
If `StudentService` depends on `StudentRepository`, and you use the `new` keyword to create the service, testing it would be cumbersome, and you can't easily inject a mock repository.

---

### **6. No Dependency Resolution by Spring**
With DI, Spring automatically resolves dependencies at runtime based on annotations like `@Autowired`. When you manually instantiate an object with `new`, Spring cannot resolve or inject dependencies automatically. This could lead to **NullPointerExceptions** or other issues where objects that should be injected remain `null`.

#### Example:
```java
@Service
public class StudentService {

    @Autowired
    private StudentRepository studentRepository;

    public StudentService() {
        // This won't inject the repository
        studentRepository = new StudentRepository();  // Manual creation
    }
}
```
In this case, `studentRepository` will be created manually, and the `@Autowired` dependency will not be injected, potentially leading to a `NullPointerException` when you try to use the repository.

---

### **7. Loss of Spring Context and Scopes**
In Spring, beans can have different scopes (like singleton, prototype, request, session, etc.). When using `new`, you lose these contextual bindings.

- **Singleton scope**: If you use `new` to create an instance, you'll end up with a new instance every time, even if the bean should be a singleton.
- **Prototype scope**: Spring manages bean creation and its lifecycle according to its scope annotations. Using `new` bypasses this, meaning you cannot control the scope properly.

---

### **Conclusion:**
While it **won't throw an immediate exception** in some cases, using the `new` keyword in Spring instead of **dependency injection** generally causes the following issues:

1. **No automatic dependency injection** â€” required dependencies won't be injected by Spring.
2. **Tight coupling** â€” makes the code harder to test, maintain, and extend.
3. **No integration with Springâ€™s AOP, lifecycle, and IoC container** â€” you'll miss out on Spring features like `@Transactional`, proxies, and lifecycle management.
4. **Harder testing** â€” unit tests become more difficult, as you can't inject mocks easily.

To leverage Spring's full power, it's always best to use **dependency injection** and avoid manually instantiating Spring-managed beans using `new`.

# Que 10. @PathParam vs @QueryParam

In **Spring MVC** or **Spring Boot**, `@PathParam` and `@QueryParam` are used to extract values from **RESTful** URLs, but they differ in how the data is passed in the URL. 

Spring provides annotations like `@PathVariable` and `@RequestParam` (not `@PathParam` and `@QueryParam` as in JAX-RS) for handling these cases. Here's a detailed explanation of **`@PathVariable`** and **`@RequestParam`**:

---

### **1. Path Variables (`@PathVariable`)**
- **Used for extracting values from the URI path.**
- Path variables are part of the URL path and are often used for resource identification.
- The path variable is embedded in the URI (i.e., the URL itself), and the values are mapped to method parameters.

#### Example:
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/students")
public class StudentController {

    // Extracting ID from the URL path
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String getStudent(@PathVariable("id") String studentId) {
        return "Student ID: " + studentId;
    }
}
```

#### URL Example:
```plaintext
GET /students/12345
```
- Here, `12345` is the **path variable**, and `@PathVariable("id")` will capture it into the method parameter `studentId`.

---

### **2. Query Parameters (`@RequestParam`)**
- **Used for extracting values from the query string (i.e., parameters that come after the `?` in the URL).**
- Query parameters are typically used for filtering, sorting, pagination, or passing additional data to the backend.
- Multiple query parameters can be passed in a URL, and you can retrieve each one using `@RequestParam`.

#### Example:
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/students")
public class StudentController {

    // Extracting query parameters
    @GetMapping("/")
    public String getStudents(@RequestParam("age") int age, @RequestParam("name") String name) {
        return "Fetching students with age: " + age + " and name: " + name;
    }
}
```

#### URL Example:
```plaintext
GET /students?age=20&name=John
```
- In this case, the query parameters `age=20` and `name=John` will be mapped to the method parameters `age` and `name`.

---

### **Key Differences**

| Feature                   | **Path Variables (`@PathVariable`)**                 | **Query Parameters (`@RequestParam`)**                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Position in URL**        | Part of the URL path (`/students/{id}`)              | After the `?` symbol in the URL (`/students?id=1`)     |
| **Use Case**               | Often used to identify a specific resource or entity | Often used for filtering, sorting, or optional parameters |
| **Syntax**                 | `/students/{id}`                                     | `/students?id=1`                                      |
| **Example**                | `/students/123`                                      | `/students?id=123&age=20`                             |
| **Required or Optional**   | Typically required (a part of the URL)              | Can be optional or required, depending on the query string |
| **Default Values**         | No default values can be set for path variables.     | Can set default values using `defaultValue` parameter |

---

### **3. Combining Both in a Single Request**
You can use both `@PathVariable` and `@RequestParam` together in a single API endpoint. This is common when you need to retrieve a specific resource and provide additional filters or options.

#### Example:
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/students")
public class StudentController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String getStudent(
        @PathVariable("id") String studentId,
        @RequestParam(value = "age", required = false) Integer age,
        @RequestParam(value = "name", required = false) String name
    ) {
        return "Student ID: " + studentId + 
               ", Age: " + (age != null ? age : "not provided") + 
               ", Name: " + (name != null ? name : "not provided");
    }
}
```

#### URL Examples:
```plaintext
GET /students/12345?age=20&name=John  // With query parameters
GET /students/12345                   // Only path variable
```

- In the first case, `id=12345` is the **path variable**, and `age=20` and `name=John` are **query parameters**.
- In the second case, only the **path variable** is used.

---

### **Summary:**
- **`@PathVariable`**: Extracts values from the **path** of the URL. Often used for resource identifiers (e.g., `/students/12345`).
- **`@RequestParam`**: Extracts values from the **query string** (after `?`). Used for optional parameters, filtering, pagination, etc. (e.g., `/students?id=1&name=John`).

Both of these annotations are used to capture data from the request URL, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.

# Que 11. RestController vs Controller

In Spring Framework, the main difference between `@RestController` and `@Controller` lies in their intended purpose and behavior regarding the response format:

### 1. **`@Controller`**
- `@Controller` is a general-purpose annotation used to define a class as a controller in a Spring MVC application. It is typically used when handling traditional web applications that return views (like JSP, Thymeleaf, or HTML).
- When you use `@Controller`, the methods in that class are often mapped to return a view (e.g., `ModelAndView`) and not directly a response body.
- For example, methods might return a `String` representing a view name, or a `ModelAndView` that encapsulates both the view and the model.

```java
@Controller
public class WebController {

    @RequestMapping("/welcome")
    public String welcomePage(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Welcome to the site!");
        return "welcome";  // this maps to a view (e.g., welcome.jsp)
    }
}
```

### 2. **`@RestController`**
- `@RestController` is a specialization of `@Controller` in Spring. It is used for RESTful web services, where you typically want to return data directly (e.g., JSON or XML) as the response body, rather than rendering a view.
- `@RestController` combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, which means that all methods in a class annotated with `@RestController` will automatically serialize return values into JSON or other formats directly as the HTTP response body.
- It is primarily used in building APIs that respond with data, rather than rendering views.

```java
@RestController
public class ApiController {

    @RequestMapping("/api/welcome")
    public ResponseEntity<Map<String, String>> welcome() {
        Map<String, String> response = new HashMap<>();
        response.put("message", "Welcome to the API!");
        return ResponseEntity.ok(response);  // response is directly returned as JSON
    }
}
```

### Key Differences:
- **Return Type Handling**: `@Controller` is used for handling view-based responses (e.g., returning a JSP page), while `@RestController` is used for RESTful responses (e.g., returning JSON or XML data).
- **Automatic `@ResponseBody`**: In `@RestController`, each method is automatically annotated with `@ResponseBody`, meaning Spring will directly write the returned object to the HTTP response body, typically in JSON format. In contrast, with `@Controller`, you need to explicitly annotate individual methods with `@ResponseBody` to tell Spring to convert the return type into the response body.
- **Use Cases**: Use `@Controller` for web applications where you want to return a view (e.g., a webpage). Use `@RestController` for building APIs that need to return data like JSON.

### Example Scenario:
- **`@Controller`**: A traditional web app that serves HTML pages.
- **`@RestController`**: A REST API that returns data (such as JSON) to a client.

In summary, the key difference is that `@RestController` is geared for RESTful APIs and automatically handles the response body (e.g., converting to JSON), while `@Controller` is used for rendering views in traditional web applications, requiring explicit annotations for response body handling.

# Que 12. Patch vs Put

A `PATCH` request is typically used to apply partial modifications to a resource, as opposed to a `PUT` request, which replaces the entire resource. A `PATCH` request is especially useful when you want to update only a specific part of a resource without modifying the entire entity.

### **PATCH Request Example (Diff)**

If you want to send a `PATCH` request for modifying only a part of an image or user data, the body of the request will contain only the fields you wish to change. Below is an example of how the data might be represented in a `PATCH` request for updating a user's image.

**Example PATCH Request:**

```http
PATCH /api/users/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "profilePicture": "new-image.jpg"
}
```

This request updates only the `profilePicture` field of the user with `id=123`, leaving other fields unchanged.

### **Diff Representation (PATCH)**

A diff usually shows what will change between two versions of a file or resource. For example:

```diff
--- old_user_data.json
+++ new_user_data.json
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
 {
   "id": 123,
   "name": "John Doe",
-  "profilePicture": "old-image.jpg"
+  "profilePicture": "new-image.jpg"
 }
```

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the diff:
- **`--- old_user_data.json`**: Represents the current state of the data.
- **`+++ new_user_data.json`**: Represents the new state after applying the `PATCH` request.
- The **line starting with `-`** indicates the data being removed (`old-image.jpg`).
- The **line starting with `+`** shows the data being added (`new-image.jpg`).

### **PATCH vs PUT**

- **PUT** is used when you want to update the entire resource, for example, replacing all fields of an entity:
  
```http
PUT /api/users/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "profilePicture": "new-image.jpg",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

In contrast, **PATCH** only modifies the fields that are provided in the request, leaving other fields unchanged.

### Conclusion

- **PATCH** is used for partial updates and is more efficient than `PUT` when only specific fields need to be updated.
- The `diff` representation in PATCH helps visualize changes between the original and updated states.

# Que 13. SOLID principle

The **SOLID** principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming (OOP) that, when followed, help create software that is more maintainable, flexible, and scalable. They are particularly useful in Java development. Here's a breakdown of each principle:

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - **Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
   - **Example in Java**: 
     If you have a `UserManager` class that handles both user creation and user validation, it violates SRP because it has two responsibilities. A better approach would be to split these responsibilities into two classes: `UserManager` for creation and `UserValidator` for validation.

   ```java
   public class UserManager {
       private UserValidator userValidator;
       
       public UserManager(UserValidator userValidator) {
           this.userValidator = userValidator;
       }
       
       public void createUser(User user) {
           if (userValidator.isValid(user)) {
               // Code to create user
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - **Definition**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - **Example in Java**: 
     Instead of modifying a class when a new feature is added, you can extend it. For example, if you have a `Shape` class and want to add a new shape type, you can create a new class (`Rectangle`, `Circle`) without modifying the existing ones.

   ```java
   public abstract class Shape {
       public abstract double area();
   }

   public class Circle extends Shape {
       private double radius;

       public Circle(double radius) {
           this.radius = radius;
       }

       @Override
       public double area() {
           return Math.PI * radius * radius;
       }
   }
   ```

### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - **Definition**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - **Example in Java**: 
     If a subclass `Square` inherits from `Rectangle`, it should behave like a rectangle. Violating this principle could involve overriding a method in a subclass in a way that breaks its contract with the superclass.

   ```java
   public class Rectangle {
       protected int width, height;

       public void setWidth(int width) {
           this.width = width;
       }

       public void setHeight(int height) {
           this.height = height;
       }

       public int area() {
           return width * height;
       }
   }

   public class Square extends Rectangle {
       @Override
       public void setWidth(int width) {
           this.width = this.height = width;
       }

       @Override
       public void setHeight(int height) {
           this.height = this.width = height;
       }
   }
   ```

### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - **Definition**: A client should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesnâ€™t use. In other words, split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.
   - **Example in Java**: 
     If you have a large interface `Worker` with methods like `work()` and `eat()`, a `Manager` class would be forced to implement `eat()`, which doesnâ€™t make sense. You can segregate this into two interfaces: `Workable` and `Eatable`.

   ```java
   public interface Workable {
       void work();
   }

   public interface Eatable {
       void eat();
   }

   public class Worker implements Workable, Eatable {
       @Override
       public void work() {
           // Implementation
       }

       @Override
       public void eat() {
           // Implementation
       }
   }

   public class Manager implements Workable {
       @Override
       public void work() {
           // Implementation
       }
   }
   ```

### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
   - **Example in Java**: 
     Rather than having a `UserService` directly create a `UserRepository`, inject an abstraction (`UserRepository` interface), and let the high-level module depend on that abstraction.

   ```java
   public interface UserRepository {
       void save(User user);
   }

   public class UserService {
       private UserRepository userRepository;

       public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
           this.userRepository = userRepository;
       }

       public void registerUser(User user) {
           userRepository.save(user);
       }
   }
   ```

### Why SOLID Principles Are Important in Java:
- **Maintainability**: By adhering to SOLID, you ensure that your Java code remains clean, modular, and easy to maintain over time.
- **Scalability**: As your application grows, SOLID principles ensure that the code can be extended and modified without introducing errors or excessive refactoring.
- **Testability**: SOLID code is easier to unit test, as classes and methods have single responsibilities and dependencies are injected, which makes testing isolated units easier.

In summary, SOLID principles are a set of guidelines that improve code quality by promoting object-oriented design best practices. By using these principles, Java developers can build robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.

# Que 14. Daemon thread

In Java, **daemon threads** are special types of threads that run in the background and are typically used for tasks that do not need to block the termination of the program. Unlike regular threads, **daemon threads** do not prevent the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) from exiting when all non-daemon threads have finished executing. They are automatically terminated when the JVM shuts down.

### Key Characteristics of Daemon Threads:
1. **Background Tasks**: Daemon threads are designed for tasks like garbage collection, background maintenance, or other housekeeping jobs.
2. **JVM Termination**: The JVM will exit when only daemon threads remain. They do not block the JVM from terminating.
3. **Low Priority**: Typically, daemon threads have a lower priority compared to non-daemon threads, though this is not a requirement.
4. **Lifecycle**: Once all non-daemon threads finish their execution, the JVM shuts down, and daemon threads are immediately terminated without any grace period.

### Creating a Daemon Thread:
To create a daemon thread in Java, you can use the `Thread.setDaemon(true)` method. This method must be called before the thread starts executing.

### Example Code:
```java
public class DaemonThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a regular thread
        Thread regularThread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
                System.out.println("Regular thread has completed.");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Regular thread interrupted.");
            }
        });
        
        // Creating a daemon thread
        Thread daemonThread = new Thread(() -> {
            while (true) {
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                    System.out.println("Daemon thread is working...");
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    System.out.println("Daemon thread interrupted.");
                }
            }
        });

        daemonThread.setDaemon(true);  // Set as daemon thread

        regularThread.start();
        daemonThread.start();

        System.out.println("Main thread is done.");
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Main thread is done.
Daemon thread is working...
Daemon thread is working...
Daemon thread is working...
Regular thread has completed.
```

In this example:
- The **regular thread** runs for 2 seconds and then finishes.
- The **daemon thread** runs indefinitely in the background. However, once the **main thread** and **regular thread** finish, the JVM terminates, and the daemon thread is abruptly stopped, even though it's still in the middle of execution.

### When to Use Daemon Threads:
- **Background services**: For tasks like monitoring or logging that should run in the background without blocking program termination.
- **Garbage collection**: The JVM itself uses daemon threads for tasks such as garbage collection.
- **Timers or periodic tasks**: Daemon threads are good for tasks that need to run periodically but are not critical to the program's outcome.

### Important Notes:
- Daemon threads should not be used for tasks that require graceful shutdown or need to complete before the program ends. Since they do not get a chance to finish their work when the JVM terminates, any unfinished tasks may be lost.
- Itâ€™s crucial to set a thread as a daemon **before** it starts. If you try to set a thread as a daemon after it starts, an `IllegalThreadStateException` will be thrown.

# Que 15. Lifecycle of Thread

In Java, the **thread lifecycle** refers to the various stages a thread goes through during its execution, from creation to termination. Each thread goes through different states as defined by the Java Thread State model. These states are part of the thread's lifecycle.

### Thread States in Java:
1. **New (Born)**: 
   - When a thread is created but not yet started, it is in the **New** state.
   - This is the state when the thread object is instantiated using `new Thread()`.

   ```java
   Thread t = new Thread(); // Thread is in "New" state
   ```

2. **Runnable (Ready to Run)**: 
   - When the `start()` method is called, the thread moves to the **Runnable** state. It is now ready to be executed by the JVM, but the operating system scheduler decides when it will actually run.
   - A thread in the runnable state can be in one of two states: **Running** or **Waiting** (depending on whether it is actually executing at that moment).

   ```java
   t.start();  // Moves thread from "New" to "Runnable"
   ```

3. **Blocked**: 
   - A thread enters the **Blocked** state when it wants to access a resource (such as a synchronized block or method) that is currently being used by another thread. The thread will remain in the blocked state until it can acquire the necessary resource.

   ```java
   synchronized (object) {
       // Blocked if another thread is holding the lock
   }
   ```

4. **Waiting (Waiting for another thread)**:
   - A thread enters the **Waiting** state when it waits indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action. For example, if `Thread.sleep()` or `Object.wait()` is called, the thread will go into this state.
   
   ```java
   Thread.sleep(1000); // Puts the thread in the "Waiting" state
   ```

5. **Timed Waiting (Waiting for a specified period)**:
   - A thread enters the **Timed Waiting** state when it is waiting for a specified period of time, such as when `Thread.sleep()` is called with a timeout or using `join()` with a timeout.
   
   ```java
   t.sleep(1000);  // Puts the thread into "Timed Waiting" for 1000 milliseconds
   ```

6. **Terminated (Dead)**:
   - A thread enters the **Terminated** state when it has finished executing or has been terminated due to an error. The thread cannot be restarted once it reaches this state.
   
   ```java
   // After thread execution, it moves to "Terminated"
   ```

### Thread Lifecycle Flow:
- **New** â†’ The thread is created.
- **Runnable** â†’ The thread is ready to run but is waiting for CPU time.
- **Running** â†’ The thread is actually executing.
- **Blocked/Waiting/Timed Waiting** â†’ The thread is waiting for a resource or a specific condition.
- **Terminated** â†’ The thread finishes execution or has been forcibly terminated.

### Example Code Demonstrating the Thread Lifecycle:
```java
public class ThreadLifeCycleDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                System.out.println("Thread is running.");
                Thread.sleep(2000);  // Timed waiting for 2 seconds
                System.out.println("Thread resumed after sleep.");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Thread interrupted.");
            }
        });

        System.out.println("Thread state after creation: " + thread.getState()); // NEW
        thread.start();  // Starts the thread, moving it to RUNNABLE state

        // Wait for the thread to finish
        try {
            thread.join();  // Main thread waits for the other thread to finish (waiting state)
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Main thread interrupted.");
        }
        System.out.println("Thread state after completion: " + thread.getState()); // TERMINATED
    }
}
```

### Summary of Thread Lifecycle:
- **New**: Thread is created but not yet started.
- **Runnable**: Thread is ready to run and is in the queue for CPU time.
- **Blocked**: Thread is blocked waiting for a resource.
- **Waiting/Timed Waiting**: Thread is waiting for some event or for a timeout.
- **Terminated**: Thread has completed execution.

# Que 16. race condition in multithreading

In multithreading, a **race condition** occurs when two or more threads attempt to access shared resources or perform operations on data at the same time, and the final outcome depends on the timing or order of thread execution. This can lead to unpredictable results, data inconsistency, or even application crashes.

### Causes of Race Conditions
Race conditions happen when:
1. **Multiple Threads Access Shared Data**: When multiple threads access and modify shared data concurrently without proper synchronization, their operations can interfere with each other, causing inconsistent results.
2. **Non-atomic Operations**: When an operation is broken down into multiple steps (e.g., reading a value, modifying it, and writing it back), and a thread is preempted in the middle of the operation, another thread can intervene and cause incorrect results.

### Example of a Race Condition

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // This method can cause a race condition if called by multiple threads
    public void increment() {
        int temp = count;       // Read the count
        temp = temp + 1;        // Modify the count
        count = temp;           // Write the modified count back
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class RaceConditionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        // Creating two threads that will increment the counter
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());  // Expected to be 2000, but may not be
    }
}
```

In this example, multiple threads call the `increment()` method on the `Counter` class. Since the method is not synchronized, both threads may read the same value of `count` and overwrite it, causing the final result to be less than expected (2000 instead of 2000 due to race conditions).

### Avoiding Race Conditions
1. **Synchronized Methods**: By marking methods as `synchronized`, only one thread can execute them at a time, preventing multiple threads from modifying shared resources simultaneously.
   
   ```java
   public synchronized void increment() {
       count++;
   }
   ```

2. **Locks**: Using explicit locks (e.g., `ReentrantLock`), you can achieve finer control over thread synchronization, allowing you to lock only the necessary critical section.

   ```java
   ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

   public void increment() {
       lock.lock();
       try {
           count++;
       } finally {
           lock.unlock();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Atomic Variables**: For simple operations like incrementing a value, Java provides **atomic classes** like `AtomicInteger` which guarantee atomicity without explicit synchronization.

   ```java
   AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

   public void increment() {
       count.incrementAndGet();
   }
   ```

4. **Thread-Safe Collections**: Using thread-safe data structures (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`) ensures that multiple threads can safely operate on shared data without requiring manual synchronization.

# Que 17. Deadlock

A **deadlock** in multithreading occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release resources or perform actions. This results in the threads being stuck and unable to proceed. Deadlocks are a serious problem in concurrent programming because they can cause the entire application to freeze or become unresponsive.

### Conditions for Deadlock
For a deadlock to occur, the following four conditions must be true simultaneously:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: At least one resource is held in a non-shareable mode. Only one thread can hold a resource at a time.
2. **Hold and Wait**: A thread holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other threads.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from threads holding them; they must release resources voluntarily.
4. **Circular Wait**: A set of threads exist such that each thread is waiting for a resource that is held by another thread in the set, forming a cycle.

### Example of a Deadlock in Java

```java
public class DeadlockExample {
    private static final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private static final Object lock2 = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Locked lock1");
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1: Locked lock2");
                }
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Locked lock2");
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2: Locked lock1");
                }
            }
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `thread1` locks `lock1` and then tries to lock `lock2`.
- `thread2` locks `lock2` and then tries to lock `lock1`.
- Both threads are now waiting for each other to release the locks, resulting in a **deadlock**.

### Avoiding Deadlocks
To prevent deadlocks, you can follow various strategies:

1. **Lock Ordering**: Ensure that all threads acquire locks in the same order. For example, always lock `lock1` before `lock2`.
   
   ```java
   synchronized (lock1) {
       synchronized (lock2) {
           // Do something
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Timeouts**: Use timeouts when attempting to acquire a lock. If a thread cannot acquire a lock within a specified time, it can release any locks it holds and retry.
   
   ```java
   if (lock1.tryLock(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
       try {
           // Proceed with the operation
       } finally {
           lock1.unlock();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Deadlock Detection**: Some systems or frameworks have mechanisms that can detect deadlocks and take corrective actions, such as restarting threads or killing the process.

4. **Using Higher-Level Concurrency Utilities**: Java provides classes in `java.util.concurrent` like `ReentrantLock` that allow more flexible locking strategies, including fairness policies and tryLock() with timeouts.

# Que 18. ACID properties

The **ACID properties** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) are a set of principles that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions, ensuring that data remains accurate and consistent even in the event of errors or system failures.

### ACID Properties Explained:
1. **Atomicity**:
   - **Definition**: Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single "unit," meaning that all operations within the transaction are either fully completed or not executed at all. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, leaving the database unchanged.
   - **Example**: When transferring money between bank accounts, if the debit operation succeeds but the credit operation fails, the transaction will be rolled back entirely to ensure consistency.

2. **Consistency**:
   - **Definition**: Consistency ensures that a transaction transforms the database from one valid state to another. The database must always adhere to the rules, constraints, and integrity conditions defined by the database schema before and after the transaction.
   - **Example**: If a database requires that a person's age be above 18 to register, the system ensures that this rule is maintained after every transaction.

3. **Isolation**:
   - **Definition**: Isolation ensures that transactions are executed independently of each other. Even though multiple transactions may run concurrently, the results of one transaction are not visible to others until the transaction is completed.
   - **Example**: In a multi-user system, two users trying to update the same record should not interfere with each other. Isolation levels (e.g., Read Committed, Serializable) define how strictly isolation is enforced.

4. **Durability**:
   - **Definition**: Durability ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it is permanent and will survive any subsequent system failures, such as power outages or crashes.
   - **Example**: If a transaction commits a payment, the record of that payment will remain in the system even if there is a system crash immediately afterward.

### Importance of ACID Properties:
- **Reliability**: By adhering to these principles, databases ensure data integrity and correctness, which is crucial for systems like banking, e-commerce, and healthcare, where accuracy is critical.
- **Error Handling**: They provide robust mechanisms to handle failures and ensure that inconsistent data is never left in the system.

# Que 19. CAP Theorem

The **CAP Theorem** (also known as Brewer's Theorem) is a concept in distributed systems that states that a distributed database system can provide at most two out of the following three guarantees at the same time:

1. **Consistency**: Every read operation will return the most recent write (or an error). Essentially, all nodes in the system have the same data view at any point in time.
2. **Availability**: Every request (read or write) will receive a response, even if some nodes are down. The system is always available to perform operations.
3. **Partition Tolerance**: The system will continue to operate even if there is a network partition (i.e., communication between nodes is lost). The system will still maintain its behavior and consistency, even if it cannot guarantee immediate updates to all nodes.

### Key Points of the CAP Theorem:
- **Consistency** and **Availability** can conflict when there is a partition. In the case of a network failure (partition), a system must choose either consistency (ensuring all data is synchronized) or availability (responding to all requests) since it cannot guarantee both during a partition.
- **Partition Tolerance** is considered a must-have in modern distributed systems because network partitions are inevitable in large, distributed systems.

### CAP Theorem Variants:
- **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**: This system ensures consistency and handles network partitions, but may sacrifice availability. An example is HBase.
- **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)**: This system ensures availability and handles network partitions, but may return stale data (sacrificing consistency). An example is CouchDB.
- **CA (Consistency + Availability)**: This system ensures that all nodes are consistent and always available, but it does not handle partitions well. This model is rare because partition tolerance is typically necessary.

### Example:
Imagine you are using a distributed database for a global online store. If a network partition occurs, a system has to choose between ensuring all customers see the same inventory (consistency) or allowing customers to place orders on available inventory even if some of the data may be outdated (availability).
