Let’s go deep into **Kafka Consumer Internals** — how it works, major configs, key mechanics, and example behavior:

---

## 🔷 **Kafka Consumer Deep Dive**

---

### 🔹 1. **What a Consumer Does**
- Connects to Kafka broker(s)
- Joins a **consumer group**
- Pulls records from one or more partitions
- Commits offsets to track progress

---

### 🔹 2. **Consumer Group**
- A **group of consumers** that **share the load**.
- Kafka guarantees each partition is consumed by **only one consumer** in the group.

#### Example:
- Topic `orders` has 3 partitions.
- Group `analytics-group` has 2 consumers:
  - C1 reads P0 and P1
  - C2 reads P2

If C2 dies, C1 takes over all 3 partitions.

---

### 🔹 3. **Poll Model**
Consumers use `poll()` to pull messages.

```java
ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
```

Kafka sends **batches of records** per partition. `poll()` must be called periodically or the consumer is considered **dead** (triggers rebalancing).

---

### 🔹 4. **Offset Management**

#### ✅ What is Offset?
- Position of a message in a partition.

#### ✅ Auto Commit (default)
```properties
enable.auto.commit = true
auto.commit.interval.ms = 5000
```
Commits latest offsets **periodically** after poll.

> ✅ Easy to use  
> ❌ Can cause **data loss** if consumer crashes before commit.

---

#### ✅ Manual Commit
You commit **after successful processing**:

```java
consumer.commitSync(); // blocking, safer
consumer.commitAsync(); // non-blocking, faster
```

> ✅ Safer for **at-least-once** semantics  
> ❌ Must handle retry logic

---

### 🔹 5. **Rebalancing**
When a consumer **joins or leaves** the group, Kafka **reassigns partitions** → called **rebalancing**.

During rebalancing:
- No messages are delivered
- It affects throughput

Kafka uses **PartitionAssignor** like:
- `RangeAssignor` (default)
- `RoundRobinAssignor`
- `StickyAssignor` (minimize movement)

---

### 🔹 6. **Deserialization**
Consumer must know how to **deserialize** key & value:

```java
key.deserializer = org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
value.deserializer = org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
```

Use Avro/JSON/etc. for structured data.

---

### 🔹 7. **Error Handling**
Use `try-catch` during processing. On error:
- **Skip**
- **Retry**
- **Move to dead letter topic (DLQ)**

---

### 🔹 8. **Consumer Lag**
Lag = **difference between last produced and last committed offset**.

Low lag = good  
High lag = processing is slow / stuck

Monitor using:
- **Kafka Manager**
- **Burrow**
- **Prometheus**

---

### 🔹 9. **Threading Model**
Kafka consumer is **not thread-safe**:
- Use **1 thread per consumer**
- Or **multithreaded processing with single poller** using worker pool

---

### 🔹 10. **Best Practices**
- Use **manual commit** for control
- Handle **retries and DLQs**
- Tune:
  - `max.poll.records`
  - `max.poll.interval.ms`
  - `session.timeout.ms`
- Monitor **consumer lag**
