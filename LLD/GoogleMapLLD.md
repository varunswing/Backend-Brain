### Data Flow and Interaction

**User Interaction:** A user logs in and performs searches for places. The Search service uses the Location and Place data to return results.

**Map Rendering:** The Map service renders the map based on the user's current Location, including Route data if the user is navigating.

**Routing:** The Routing service calculates the best route from a start Location to an end Location, considering real-time TrafficData.

**Reviews and Ratings:** Users can write Reviews for Places they visit, which are stored and displayed for other users.

**Notifications:** The system sends Notifications to users for updates such as traffic alerts, route changes, or place reviews.

**Data Management:** All data is stored in the Database and managed via the Data Storage and Management service. Integration with third-party services for additional data (e.g., traffic updates) is handled by the Third-Party Integration service.
