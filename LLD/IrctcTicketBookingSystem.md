Designing an IRCTC-like system (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation) involves managing multiple elements such as trains, routes, passengers, reservations, ticket pricing, and concurrent booking. This requires designing a scalable database schema, implementing complex queries to handle routes and booking, and ensuring that concurrency is well-managed. Here’s an outline to cover each of the focus areas:

---

## **1. Database Schema Design**

### **Core Tables**
1. **Station**
   - `station_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `city`
   - `state`

2. **Train**
   - `train_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `type` (express, local, etc.)

3. **Route**
   - `route_id` (Primary Key)
   - `train_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Train`)
   - `origin_station_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Station`)
   - `destination_station_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Station`)
   - `distance` (in km)

4. **TrainSchedule**
   - `schedule_id` (Primary Key)
   - `train_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Train`)
   - `station_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Station`)
   - `arrival_time`
   - `departure_time`
   - `stop_number` (indicates the stop sequence on the route)

5. **Seat**
   - `seat_id` (Primary Key)
   - `train_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Train`)
   - `class` (e.g., sleeper, AC, non-AC)
   - `seat_number`

6. **Booking**
   - `booking_id` (Primary Key)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing `User`)
   - `train_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Train`)
   - `route_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Route`)
   - `origin_station_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Station`)
   - `destination_station_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Station`)
   - `booking_date`
   - `travel_date`
   - `seat_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Seat`)
   - `status` (booked, cancelled, etc.)

7. **User**
   - `user_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `email`
   - `phone_number`

---

### **2. SQL Queries for Routes and Ticket Booking**

#### a. **Route Query**
To find the route and train options between two stations on a specific date:
- Select trains with schedules including both the origin and destination stations.
- Filter trains with an origin station’s `stop_number` less than the destination station’s `stop_number` (ensuring correct travel direction).

**Example Logic**:
1. Join `TrainSchedule` to `Route` and `Train` to fetch details for a particular date.
2. Filter by `origin_station_id` and `destination_station_id`, ordered by the schedule `stop_number`.

#### b. **Available Seats Query**
To check available seats on a specific route:
- Join the `Seat`, `Booking`, and `TrainSchedule` tables.
- Filter seats that are not already booked for the desired date.

**Example Logic**:
1. For a specific `train_id`, check the `Seat` table for available seats by `class`.
2. Exclude seats from the `Booking` table that are already booked for the travel date, route, and specified origin-destination stations.

#### c. **Booking Query**
To book a ticket:
- Reserve a seat if it’s available by creating an entry in the `Booking` table.
- Update the status of the booking to confirm.

**Example Logic**:
1. Check the `Seat` availability as per the query above.
2. Insert a new record in the `Booking` table with the required `user_id`, `train_id`, `seat_id`, etc.

---

### **3. Handling Concurrent Bookings**

Concurrency is essential to prevent multiple users from booking the same seat. Here are some techniques to manage this:

#### a. **Pessimistic Locking**
- Use database locking to **lock the seat records** being checked until the transaction completes.
- This prevents other transactions from reading or writing to the locked rows, ensuring that once a seat is confirmed as available, it cannot be double-booked.

#### b. **Optimistic Locking**
- Use an **optimistic lock** with a `version` field in the `Seat` table.
- When a seat is being updated, check the version, and if it has changed, abort the transaction, prompting the user to retry.

#### c. **Atomic Database Transactions**
- Use atomic transactions to ensure all related operations (seat check, booking creation, seat status update) happen together.
- If any part of the transaction fails, the entire operation is rolled back, preventing partial updates.

#### d. **Queue-Based Booking System**
- For high-load scenarios, a queuing system can be implemented to **manage booking requests sequentially**.
- Bookings are processed one by one in the queue, which reduces contention on the database and prevents race conditions.

---

## **Example Workflow for Booking Process**

1. **Seat Availability Check**:
   - Query available seats with filtering and concurrency handling as described.

2. **Begin Transaction**:
   - If using a relational database, start a transaction.

3. **Lock Seat**:
   - Lock the seat row to prevent access by other booking requests.

4. **Insert Booking**:
   - Insert a record in the `Booking` table with details of the passenger, route, and seat.

5. **Commit Transaction**:
   - Commit the transaction to finalize the booking.

6. **Release Locks**:
   - Release any locks held on seat rows to make them accessible for other users.

This design ensures data integrity, availability, and scalability, especially for a high-traffic system like IRCTC. Additional enhancements like caching commonly queried data (e.g., routes, train schedules) in Redis or another cache layer can further optimize performance and user experience.

To design an IRCTC-like system, we’ll list out the functional and non-functional requirements, then detail the APIs and services that should be implemented, including functional considerations.

---

### **Functional Implementation Considerations**

- **Atomic Transactions for Bookings**: Each booking transaction should lock the seats and finalize only if payment succeeds. Use transactions to avoid partial updates.
  
- **Distributed Locking for Concurrency**: Implement a distributed locking mechanism (like Redis) for seat availability checks to prevent overselling in high-demand scenarios.

- **Session and Token Management**: Store tokens securely and implement session timeouts for active user sessions. Use JWT for user authentication and role-based authorization for admin actions.

- **Asynchronous Handling of Long Operations**: Background tasks like sending notifications or processing refunds should use asynchronous handling (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).

---

Here’s a sample implementation of the IRCTC-like system in Java with Spring Boot. The code covers essential aspects of the User, Train, and Booking services along with basic setups for database and REST endpoints.

}
```

---

### **4. Service Layer**

#### a. `UserService.java`

```java
@Service
public class UserService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    public User registerUser(User user) {
        return userRepository.save(user);
    }

    public Optional<User> findByUsername(String username) {
        return userRepository.findByUsername(username);
    }
}
```

#### b. `BookingService.java`

```java
@Service
public class BookingService {

    @Autowired
    private BookingRepository bookingRepository;

    @Autowired
    private TrainRepository trainRepository;

    @Transactional
    public Booking createBooking(Long userId, Long trainId, LocalDate travelDate) {
        // Find the train by ID
        Train train = trainRepository.findById(trainId).orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Train not found"));

        // Check availability
        List<Booking> existingBookings = bookingRepository.findByTrainAndTravelDate(train, travelDate);
        if (existingBookings.size() >= train.getCapacity()) {
            throw new RuntimeException("No seats available");
        }

        // Create booking
        Booking booking = new Booking();
        booking.setUser(new User(userId));
        booking.setTrain(train);
        booking.setTravelDate(travelDate);
        booking.setStatus("BOOKED");

        return bookingRepository.save(booking);
    }
}
```

---

### **5. Controller Layer**

#### a. `UserController.java`

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;

    @PostMapping("/register")
    public ResponseEntity<User> registerUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        User registeredUser = userService.registerUser(user);
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(registeredUser);
    }
}
```

#### b. `BookingController.java`

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/bookings")
public class BookingController {

    @Autowired
    private BookingService bookingService;

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<Booking> createBooking(@RequestParam Long userId, @RequestParam Long trainId, @RequestParam LocalDate travelDate) {
        Booking booking = bookingService.createBooking(userId, trainId, travelDate);
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(booking);
    }
}
```

---

### **6. Security Configuration for JWT Authentication**

Here is a basic setup for securing the API endpoints:

#### `SecurityConfig.java`

```java
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable()
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/api/users/register", "/api/users/login").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);
        
        // JWT filter should be added here
    }
}
```

For production, add a JWT filter for token validation, and configure role-based access as needed.

---

### **7. Exception Handling**

To provide meaningful responses for errors, set up a custom exception handler:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(RuntimeException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleRuntimeException(RuntimeException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST).body(ex.getMessage());
    }
}
```

---

### **8. Testing and Running**

1. **Run Application**: With Spring Boot, simply run the `main` method in `Application.java` to start the application.
2. **API Testing**: Use a tool like Postman to test the endpoints. Begin by creating a user, then proceed to book tickets.

### **Next Steps**

For a production-ready implementation, consider:
- **Adding Redis or other cache** for frequently accessed data, like train schedules.
- **Implementing distributed locking** in the `BookingService` to handle concurrent bookings.
- **Configuring a messaging queue** for sending asynchronous notifications. 

This setup provides a foundation that can be enhanced based on additional requirements.

For an IRCTC-like ticket booking system, several design patterns can enhance modularity, flexibility, and scalability. Here are some design patterns that could be applicable:

### 1. **Singleton Pattern**
   - **Usage**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
   - **Where to Apply**: Database connections, logging, or configuration services.
   - **Implementation**:
     - For instance, a singleton configuration class can handle properties for database connections, ensuring that only one instance is used throughout the application.

### 2. **Factory Pattern**
   - **Usage**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.
   - **Where to Apply**: In the booking service for generating different types of bookings (e.g., regular booking, waitlist booking, or priority booking).
   - **Implementation**:
     - Create a `BookingFactory` class with methods to create `Booking` objects based on booking type.

### 3. **Builder Pattern**
   - **Usage**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
   - **Where to Apply**: In creating complex objects like `TrainSchedule` or `Booking` that may require multiple steps or optional attributes (e.g., booking with specific seat types).
   - **Implementation**:
     - Implement a `BookingBuilder` class for building booking details with optional fields like meal preferences, seat choice, etc.

### 4. **Strategy Pattern**
   - **Usage**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
   - **Where to Apply**: In the context of calculating fares based on different discount policies, booking rules, or cancellation policies.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Define a `FareCalculationStrategy` interface, with different implementations for standard fares, discounted fares, or premium fares. In the `BookingService`, the appropriate strategy can be selected based on the type of booking.

### 5. **Observer Pattern**
   - **Usage**: When an object, known as the subject, changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified automatically.
   - **Where to Apply**: For sending notifications to users when their booking status changes or for notifying multiple services of a booking update.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Set up a `BookingObserver` that observes booking status changes and sends notifications or triggers further updates, like sending a confirmation email or SMS.

### 6. **Command Pattern**
   - **Usage**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing users to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
   - **Where to Apply**: For handling different user actions in the booking process (e.g., booking, cancellation, modification).
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use `BookingCommand` objects that encapsulate booking-related actions. This can also facilitate queuing, undoing, or retrying actions in cases of temporary booking failures.

### 7. **Proxy Pattern**
   - **Usage**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
   - **Where to Apply**: When accessing external systems, such as external payment gateways or user verification services.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Implement a `PaymentServiceProxy` that can add authentication, logging, or caching before delegating to the actual payment processor.

### 8. **Decorator Pattern**
   - **Usage**: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
   - **Where to Apply**: For adding additional behaviors or options to a booking, like meal options, travel insurance, or seat upgrades.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use a `BookingDecorator` class that can add optional services, such as insurance or special meal preferences, on top of a standard booking.

### 9. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
   - **Usage**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
   - **Where to Apply**: For validating booking requests or handling booking requests in multiple steps.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Create a chain of validators that handle requests sequentially, such as validating user identity, checking seat availability, and confirming payment before finalizing the booking.

### 10. **Template Method Pattern**
   - **Usage**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
   - **Where to Apply**: For the booking process workflow, where certain steps might differ based on the type of booking.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Define a `BookingProcessTemplate` with the common steps (like validate, reserve, confirm), while specific implementations (like `VIPBookingProcess` and `RegularBookingProcess`) implement the details for those steps.

### 11. **Adapter Pattern**
   - **Usage**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
   - **Where to Apply**: When integrating third-party APIs like for payments or SMS gateways.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Create an `SMSAdapter` or `PaymentAdapter` to wrap third-party API logic and adapt it to fit the existing internal service requirements.

Using these patterns strategically can improve the maintainability, testability, and robustness of the booking system while allowing flexibility for future changes or feature additions.

For a complex ticket-booking system like IRCTC, meeting non-functional requirements is crucial for ensuring reliability, scalability, performance, and user satisfaction. Here’s how to address key non-functional requirements for such a system:

---

### 1. **Scalability**
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Use a load balancer (e.g., Nginx or AWS ELB) to distribute traffic across multiple application instances.
   - **Database Sharding**: Partition the database horizontally to distribute the load, for example, sharding by user ID or region.
   - **Caching**: Use distributed caching (e.g., Redis or Memcached) for frequently accessed data, like train schedules, station information, and booking status.
   - **Microservices**: Divide the application into microservices (user, booking, payment, train schedule) to enable independent scaling of each component.

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Caching Strategy**: Implement a cache layer with Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
   - **Async Processing**: Offload non-essential or delayed processes to background tasks using message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for notifications or invoice generation.
   - **Database Indexing**: Use indexes on frequently queried fields, such as train ID, date, and booking ID, to speed up database queries.
   - **Connection Pooling**: Use HikariCP with efficient connection pooling for the database to reduce the overhead of creating and closing connections.

### 3. **Reliability and Availability**
   - **Database Replication and Failover**: Implement replication and failover strategies in the database (e.g., master-slave configuration in MySQL, or managed database services like AWS RDS).
   - **Redundancy in Services**: Deploy multiple instances of each microservice to avoid single points of failure.
   - **Auto-Scaling**: Use auto-scaling policies in cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure) to handle traffic spikes during high booking periods.
   - **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Use libraries like Resilience4j or Hystrix to gracefully handle failures and avoid cascading failures.
   - **Graceful Degradation**: Display a "light" version of the application (e.g., limited train schedules or static content) when some services are down.

### 4. **Security**
   - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data, like payment details and personal user information, using SSL/TLS for in-transit data and AES encryption for at-rest data.
   - **Authentication & Authorization**: Use OAuth2 with JWT for secure, token-based authentication, and enforce role-based access control (RBAC) for users.
   - **Audit Logging**: Log all significant actions, such as booking creation, modification, and cancellations, with an audit trail for security compliance.
   - **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse or accidental overuse of services, especially during peak hours.

### 5. **Concurrency and Consistency**
   - **Optimistic Locking**: Use optimistic locking to prevent race conditions on ticket inventory. This helps handle concurrent booking requests effectively.
   - **Distributed Locking**: Use Redis or Zookeeper for distributed locking to handle high concurrency when modifying shared resources (e.g., seat availability).
   - **Eventual Consistency**: For certain non-critical operations (e.g., notifications, logs), consider using eventual consistency to improve performance and avoid bottlenecks.
   - **Data Versioning**: Keep versioned data to help with rollback mechanisms, especially useful for high-concurrency situations where partial updates may occur.

### 6. **Observability and Monitoring**
   - **Health Checks**: Implement regular health checks for services, and use Spring Boot Actuator for endpoints to monitor service status.
   - **Logging**: Use a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to gather logs and troubleshoot issues quickly.
   - **Monitoring and Alerts**: Use Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring of system metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, response times) and set up alerts for critical issues.
   - **Tracing**: Implement distributed tracing (e.g., using Zipkin or Jaeger) to trace and troubleshoot requests across microservices, improving debugging in complex systems.

### 7. **Fault Tolerance**
   - **Circuit Breakers**: Use circuit breakers (Resilience4j) to gracefully handle service failures and avoid repeated, unsuccessful calls to down services.
   - **Retry and Backoff**: Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures (e.g., temporary database or network issues).
   - **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensure services handle shutdowns gracefully, such as allowing active transactions to complete and freeing up resources.
   - **Fallbacks**: Implement fallback logic where possible, like providing alternate information if real-time data is temporarily unavailable.

### 8. **Maintainability**
   - **Modular Codebase**: Structure the codebase following a clean architecture with separate layers for services, repositories, and controllers to ensure ease of maintenance.
   - **Automated Testing**: Maintain a robust testing suite with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure functionality works as expected.
   - **Documentation**: Maintain proper documentation using Swagger for API documentation and include in-code comments, especially for complex logic.

### 9. **Data Backup and Recovery**
   - **Automated Backups**: Use automated daily backups for critical data (like user and booking data) and maintain an offsite backup for disaster recovery.
   - **Point-in-Time Recovery**: For databases, configure point-in-time recovery to restore data to a previous state if needed.
   - **Data Archival**: Periodically archive old booking data to separate storage to keep the primary database size manageable.

### 10. **User Experience (UX) Optimization**
   - **Minimal Response Times**: Use asynchronous processing for non-critical tasks to minimize response times for end-users.
   - **Progressive Loading**: For a better experience on mobile and web, use progressive loading for large data sets like train schedules or booking histories.
   - **Graceful Error Messages**: Show user-friendly error messages and allow users to retry actions (like re-attempting booking) when transient errors occur.

By implementing these non-functional requirements, you create a robust and user-friendly system capable of handling high traffic and complex booking operations while ensuring security, availability, and a seamless user experience.
