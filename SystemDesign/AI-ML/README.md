# AI/ML for Senior Software Developers

## 🎯 Why Learn AI/ML in 2026?

As a senior developer, AI is no longer optional. You need to:
- **Integrate AI** into applications (APIs, embeddings, RAG)
- **Build AI-powered features** (chatbots, search, recommendations)
- **Use AI tools** effectively (Copilot, Cursor, Claude)
- **Understand limitations** (hallucinations, prompt injection, costs)
