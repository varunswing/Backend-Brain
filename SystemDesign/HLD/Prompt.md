If you are unfamiliar with the tool, you can simply describe your design to the chat bot and ask it to generate a starter diagram for you to modify... 
Request flows Explain how the request flows from end to end in your high level design. 
Also you could draw a sequence diagram using the diagramming tool to enhance your explanation... 
Detailed component design Dig deeper into 2-3 components and explain in detail how they work. 
For example, how well does each component scale? Any relevant algorithm or data structure you like to use for a component? Also you could draw a diagram using the diagramming tool to enhance your design... 
Trade offs/Tech choices Explain any trade offs you have made and why you made certain tech choices...
