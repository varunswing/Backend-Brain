# **Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling**

## âœ… **1. Definitions**

### ðŸ”¹ **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)**

Increasing the **power (CPU, RAM, storage)** of a single server/machine.

* Example: Upgrade a server from 8 GB RAM to 32 GB RAM.

### ðŸ”¹ **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)**

Increasing the number of **machines/instances** to distribute the load.

* Example: Add more nodes to a cluster behind a load balancer.

## âœ… **2. Key Differences**

| Feature               | Vertical Scaling (Up)         | Horizontal Scaling (Out)                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Approach**          | Upgrade hardware              | Add more servers                            |
| **Cost**              | Initially cheaper             | Higher infra + network costs                |
| **Scalability Limit** | Limited by machine specs      | Virtually unlimited                         |
| **Downtime Required** | Often yes (restart needed)    | Usually no                                  |
| **Fault Tolerance**   | Low (single point of failure) | High (multi-node setup)                     |
| **Implementation**    | Easier                        | Requires orchestration (load balancer, etc) |
| **Elasticity**        | Low                           | High                                        |
| **Example**           | Upgrade EC2 instance type     | Auto-scale group of EC2s                    |

## âœ… **3. Use Cases**

### ðŸŸ© Use Vertical Scaling When:

* App is **monolithic** and doesnâ€™t support horizontal scaling well.
* You need **quick performance gain** without architectural change.
* **Small teams** with limited infrastructure management capability.
* You have **stateful apps** (e.g., legacy databases like MySQL).

### ðŸŸ¦ Use Horizontal Scaling When:

* App is **stateless and distributed** (e.g., microservices).
* Need **high availability** and fault tolerance.
* System must handle **spiky or unpredictable traffic**.
* You're using **cloud-native architecture** (Kubernetes, ECS, etc.).
* You plan for **auto-scaling, elasticity, and zero downtime**.

## âœ… **4. Examples**

### ðŸ“Œ **Vertical Scaling**

* Upgrade `t2.medium` (2 vCPU, 4GB) â†’ `t2.2xlarge` (8 vCPU, 32GB) in AWS.
* Increase RAM/CPU of MySQL DB server.

### ðŸ“Œ **Horizontal Scaling**

* Add 5 more web servers behind an ALB in AWS.
* Scale Kafka brokers, Redis cluster, or a Kubernetes Deployment (replicas).

---

## âœ… **5. Challenges and Considerations**

### ðŸ”¸ **Vertical Scaling**

* **Hardware Limitations**: Can't scale indefinitely.
* **Downtime**: Often needs restart.
* **Cost per core/GB** increases with higher-end machines.
* **Single Point of Failure**: No redundancy.

### ðŸ”¸ **Horizontal Scaling**

* **Complexity**: Requires load balancing, coordination.
* **Session Management**: Need to handle state (use Redis, sticky sessions).
* **Data Consistency**: More challenging in distributed systems.
* **Network Latency**: Can increase due to cross-node communication.

## âœ… **6. Performance & Architecture Implications**

| Aspect                  | Vertical Scaling           | Horizontal Scaling                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Latency**             | Lower (same machine)       | May be higher (network overhead)        |
| **Availability**        | Lower (if machine crashes) | Higher (redundant nodes)                |
| **Maintainability**     | Simpler                    | Requires orchestration (K8s, ECS, etc.) |
| **Load Distribution**   | Not applicable             | Requires Load Balancer                  |
| **Storage Consistency** | Easier to manage           | Needs eventual consistency approaches   |

## âœ… **7. Cost Considerations**

* **Vertical Scaling**:

  * Cheaper to start.
  * More expensive at higher tiers (diminishing returns).
  * Not fault-tolerant.

* **Horizontal Scaling**:

  * Higher base cost (infra, load balancer).
  * Better ROI as traffic grows.
  * High fault tolerance reduces downtime cost.

## âœ… **8. Real-World Systems**

| System            | Scaling Type Used | Notes                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Relational DB** | Vertical (often)  | Hard to shard; prefers stronger CPU           |
| **Web servers**   | Horizontal        | Easily replicable; stateless                  |
| **Redis**         | Both              | Add memory (vertical) or cluster (horizontal) |
| **Kafka**         | Horizontal        | Add brokers/partitions for throughput         |
| **ElasticSearch** | Horizontal        | Shard-based distributed architecture          |

---

## âœ… **9. Hybrid Approach**

Most real-world systems use **both**:

* Scale **vertically** to a sweet spot (max machine value-to-cost ratio).
* Then **scale horizontally** for reliability and capacity.

> Example: Upgrade database to 32 GB RAM, then shard and replicate across regions.
