**Mastering LLD (Low Level Design)** for interviews is crucial especially for backend/system design roles. Here's the **full roadmap** based on how top candidates prepare and crack companies like Amazon, Uber, Swiggy, etc.:

---

### 1. **Strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Foundation**
- **Master SOLID principles**:
  - S: Single Responsibility
  - O: Open-Closed
  - L: Liskov Substitution
  - I: Interface Segregation
  - D: Dependency Inversion
- **Master OOP concepts**:
  - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism
- **Learn common OOP patterns**: Builder, Factory, Strategy, Observer, Singleton.

🔵 **Practice**:  
> Pick small systems (e.g., ATM Machine, Parking Lot, Hotel Management) and design the classes, relationships, and apply SOLID.

---

### 2. **Standard Design Patterns Knowledge**
Understand where and why to use each pattern:
- **Creational**: Singleton, Factory, Builder
- **Structural**: Adapter, Decorator, Composite
- **Behavioral**: Strategy, Observer, State, Command

🔵 **Practice**:  
> When you design a system, **think which pattern solves which problem** (eg: Factory for object creation control, Observer for notification).

---

### 3. **Practice 30–50 Popular LLD Problems Deeply**
For every problem:
- **Write**:
  - Functional Requirements
  - Non-Functional Requirements
  - Entities/Classes
  - Relationships
  - Class Diagrams
  - Major Functions
  - Database Schema
  - APIs
  - Design Patterns Used
  - Handle Edge Cases, Concurrency
- Some must-practice LLD problems:
  - BookMyShow
  - Food Delivery App (Swiggy, Zomato)
  - Parking Lot System
  - Elevator/Lift System
  - Splitwise
  - Cab Booking (Ola, Uber)
  - Hotel Room Booking
  - Online Shopping Cart
  - Flight/Train Reservation System
  - News Feed System (Facebook)
  - Notification Service
  - Library Management System
  - Cricket Score Board
  - Social Media Platform (Instagram/Twitter)
  
🔵 **Tip**:  
> Solve deeply, **don't skip writing the class signatures and explaining relationships clearly**.

---

### 4. **DB Schema Design**
You must learn:
- How to normalize tables (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- When to denormalize
- How to design:
  - One-to-One
  - One-to-Many
  - Many-to-Many
  - Use indexes, composite keys
- Understand **SQL vs NoSQL** decision making.

🔵 **Practice**:  
> Design DB for 10+ systems like Food Delivery, BookMyShow, Uber, Splitwise, etc.

---

### 5. **Concurrency and Fault Tolerance**
- How to handle race conditions (Seat Booking example).
- Locks (Optimistic and Pessimistic locking).
- Distributed locking (e.g., Redis-based locks).
- Retry mechanism (with idempotency).
- Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for eventual consistency.

🔵 **Practice**:  
> Especially Booking, Payment, or Order-related systems.

---

### 6. **Follow a Structured Template**
Whenever asked to design:
✅ Define Problem  
✅ Functional and Non-Functional Requirements  
✅ Class Diagram (UML)  
✅ Define APIs (request/response)  
✅ Design Database Schema  
✅ Explain flow  
✅ Explain concurrency handling  
✅ Mention Scaling approach  
✅ Mention design patterns

🔵 **Tip**:  
> This **template** ensures you **never miss anything during the interview** even if you're nervous.

---

### 7. **Mock Interviews**
- Take **mock interviews** with friends or online platforms (e.g., Pramp, InterviewBit, etc).
- Record yourself explaining a system aloud.
- Get feedback on **structure, depth, clarity**.

---

### 8. **Speed + Depth**
- Initially it will take 2–3 hours per problem.
- Gradually target **explaining a full LLD in 45-60 minutes**.
- You must be able to **write classes and explain APIs without looking up**.

---

### 9. **Top Resources**
- **Book**: "Grokking the Object-Oriented Design Interview" (MUST).
- **YouTube**:  
  - CodeKarle  
  - SuccessInTech  
  - TakeUForward  
  - Java Brains (for core OOP understanding)
- **Courses**:
  - "Scaler Academy - Low Level Design"
  - "Design Gurus - LLD for Interviews"

---

### Final Advice:  
📍 **Consistency beats cramming.**  
📍 **Design simple systems first, then complex ones.**  
📍 **Focus on thinking about future extensibility and failure handling.**  
📍 **Explain why you designed it that way.**
