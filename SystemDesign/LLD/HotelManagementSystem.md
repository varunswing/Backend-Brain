Designing a **Hotel Booking System** involves creating a comprehensive architecture that supports various functionalities such as hotel and room inventory management, user bookings, reviews, payments, and an admin interface. Below, I’ll provide a detailed design covering the required components, their interactions, and a database schema to meet these requirements.

## 1. Overview of Components 

### Core Entities
1. Hotel: Represents a hotel with various room types and amenities.
2. RoomType: Defines different room categories (e.g., Single, Double, Suite) within a hotel.
3. RoomInventory: Tracks the availability of rooms for specific dates.
4. Booking: Represents a reservation made by a user.
5. User: Represents customers using the system to book rooms.
6. Review: Allows users to leave feedback on hotels and rooms.
7. Payment: Handles payment processing for bookings.
8. Admin: Manages hotel inventory, bookings, and generates reports.


### Service Components
1. HotelService: Manages hotel information, including room types and inventory.
2. BookingService: Handles room search, booking, cancellation, and refund operations.
3. ReviewService: Manages user reviews and ratings.
4. PaymentService: Processes payments and applies discounts.
5. AdminService: Provides an interface for hotel management and reporting.


### Concurrency and Consistency Handling
1. Distributed Locking: Ensures atomicity and consistency in room availability during the booking process.

    public void generateRevenueReport(LocalDate startDate, LocalDate endDate) {
        // Generate report on revenue and other metrics
    }
    
    public void addAdmin(String name, String email, String password) {
        // Add new admin user
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** AdminService provides an interface for administrators to monitor bookings, generate reports, and manage hotel inventory.

### 2.9. Workflow Example
Step-by-step process during a hotel booking:

1. User Searches for Hotels:
    * User searches for hotels using HotelService, specifying location, dates, and desired amenities.
2. Viewing Hotel Details:
    * User views details of a selected hotel
3. Viewing Room Availability:
    * User checks available room types and their prices for the selected dates using the RoomInventory and RoomType data.
4. Creating a Booking:
    * User selects a room type and provides check-in/check-out dates.
    * *BookingService* checks availability using RoomInventory and reserves rooms.
    * If successful, a booking is created with the Booking status set to "CONFIRMED."
5. Processing Payment:
    * User is directed to the payment gateway.
    * PaymentService processes the payment by deducting the total amount and applying any discounts.
    * Upon successful payment, the Payment status is set to "COMPLETED," and the booking is confirmed.
6. Booking Confirmation:
    * The user receives a booking confirmation via email or SMS.
    * AdminService updates the hotel’s occupancy data.
7. Cancellation or Refund:
    * If the user cancels the booking, BookingService changes the booking status to "CANCELLED."
    * PaymentService processes the refund, updating the Payment status to "REFUNDED."
    * The RoomInventory is updated to release the reserved rooms.
8. Leaving a Review:
    * After completing their stay, the user can leave a review through ReviewService.
    * The overall hotel rating is recalculated based on all reviews.

## 3. Database Schema Design

To support the components, we’ll design the following database tables:

## 4. Sequence Diagrams

### 4.1. Booking Flow
1. User searches for hotels: Sends search parameters (location, dates, amenities) to HotelService.
2. System returns results: HotelService fetches hotel and room type data, filtering by availability.
3. User selects a room: Room data is fetched using RoomType and RoomInventory.
4. User initiates booking: BookingService validates availability and creates a booking.
5. Payment is processed: PaymentService processes the payment, and booking is confirmed if successful.
6. Confirmation is sent to the user.

## 5. Scalability Considerations

1. Database Sharding:

    * Hotels and bookings data can be sharded based on geographical regions to distribute the load and reduce response times for location-based searches.

2. Caching:

    * Use caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed data like hotel details, room availability, and reviews to reduce database load.

3. Microservices Architecture:

    * Separate services for Booking, Payments, and Reviews into distinct microservices to ensure scalability and easier maintenance.

4. Load Balancing:

    * Implement load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers and ensure high availability.

This comprehensive design ensures that the Hotel Booking System is scalable, reliable, and covers all core functionalities like booking, payments, reviews, and admin reporting.
