Designing a **Hotel Booking System** involves creating a comprehensive architecture that supports various functionalities such as hotel and room inventory management, user bookings, reviews, payments, and an admin interface. Below, I’ll provide a detailed design covering the required components, their interactions, and a database schema to meet these requirements.

## 1. Overview of Components 

### Core Entities
1. Hotel: Represents a hotel with various room types and amenities.
2. RoomType: Defines different room categories (e.g., Single, Double, Suite) within a hotel.
3. RoomInventory: Tracks the availability of rooms for specific dates.
4. Booking: Represents a reservation made by a user.
5. User: Represents customers using the system to book rooms.
6. Review: Allows users to leave feedback on hotels and rooms.
7. Payment: Handles payment processing for bookings.
8. Admin: Manages hotel inventory, bookings, and generates reports.


### Service Components
1. HotelService: Manages hotel information, including room types and inventory.
2. BookingService: Handles room search, booking, cancellation, and refund operations.
3. ReviewService: Manages user reviews and ratings.
4. PaymentService: Processes payments and applies discounts.
5. AdminService: Provides an interface for hotel management and reporting.


### Concurrency and Consistency Handling
1. Distributed Locking: Ensures atomicity and consistency in room availability during the booking process.
2. Transaction Management: Handles atomic operations for booking and payment processes.

## 2. Class Diagrams and Definitions
We’ll define classes for each component with their respective attributes and methods.

### 2.1. Hotel
```java
public class Hotel {
    private String hotelId;
    private String name;
    private String location;
    private String description;
    private List<RoomType> roomTypes;
    private List<String> amenities;
    private double overallRating;
    
    // Constructors, Getters, and Setters
}
```
**Explanation:** The Hotel class stores basic information about a hotel, including room types and amenities.

### 2.2. RoomType
```java
public class RoomType {
    private String roomTypeId;
    private String hotelId;
    private String type; // e.g., Single, Double, Suite
    private double pricePerNight;
    private int maxOccupancy;
    private List<String> features;
    
    // Constructors, Getters, and Setters
}
```
**Explanation:** The RoomType class defines different categories of rooms within a hotel, including their pricing and features.

### 2.3. RoomInventory
```java
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class RoomInventory {
    private String roomTypeId;
    private LocalDate date;
    private int availableRooms;
    
    // Constructors, Getters, and Setters
    
    public synchronized boolean reserveRoom(int quantity) {
        if (availableRooms >= quantity) {
            availableRooms -= quantity;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    public synchronized void releaseRoom(int quantity) {
        availableRooms += quantity;
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** The RoomInventory class manages the availability of rooms for specific dates, ensuring thread safety during concurrent bookings.

### 2.4. Booking
```java
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Booking {
    private String bookingId;
    private String userId;
    private String hotelId;
    private String roomTypeId;
    private LocalDate checkInDate;
    private LocalDate checkOutDate;
    private int numberOfRooms;
    private double totalAmount;
    private BookingStatus status;
    
    // Constructors, Getters, and Setters
}

public enum BookingStatus {
    CONFIRMED,
    CANCELLED,
    COMPLETED,
    REFUNDED
}
```
**Explanation:** The Booking class represents a reservation made by a user, including check-in/check-out dates, the number of rooms, and the booking status.

### 2.5. User
```java
public class User {
    private String userId;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private String password;
    private String phoneNumber;
    
    // Constructors, Getters, and Setters
}
```
**Explanation:** The User class stores customer information necessary for booking and leaving reviews.

### 2.6. Review
```java
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class Review {
    private String reviewId;
    private String userId;
    private String hotelId;
    private String roomTypeId;
    private int rating; // e.g., 1 to 5 stars
    private String comment;
    private LocalDateTime reviewDate;
    
    // Constructors, Getters, and Setters
}
```
**Explanation:** The Review class allows users to leave feedback on hotels and room types, including a rating and comment.

### 2.7. Payment
```java
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class Payment {
    private String paymentId;
    private String bookingId;
    private PaymentMethod method;
    private PaymentStatus status;
    private double amount;
    private double discountApplied;
    private LocalDateTime paymentDate;
    
    // Constructors, Getters, and Setters
}

public enum PaymentMethod {
    CREDIT_CARD,
    DEBIT_CARD,
    PAYPAL,
    NET_BANKING,
    UPI
}

public enum PaymentStatus {
    PENDING,
    COMPLETED,
    FAILED,
    REFUNDED
}
```
**Explanation:** The Payment class manages payment processing for bookings, including the method, status, and any discounts applied.

### 2.8. Services
We’ll define service classes responsible for business logic and interactions between entities.

#### 2.8.1. HotelService
```java
public class HotelService {
    
    public Hotel addHotel(String name, String location, String description, List<String> amenities) {

    }
    
    public List<Hotel> searchHotels(String location, LocalDate startDate, LocalDate endDate, List<String> amenities) {
        // Logic to search hotels by location, dates, and amenities

    public void cancelBooking(String bookingId) {
        // Cancel booking and release reserved rooms
    }
    
    public Booking getBookingById(String bookingId) {
        // Retrieve booking details
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** BookingService handles room search, booking creation, and cancellation. It ensures that rooms are available before confirming a booking.

#### 2.8.3. ReviewService
```java
public class ReviewService {

### 2.9. Workflow Example
Step-by-step process during a hotel booking:

1. User Searches for Hotels:
    * User searches for hotels using HotelService, specifying location, dates, and desired amenities.
2. Viewing Hotel Details:
    * User views details of a selected hotel
