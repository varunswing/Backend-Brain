Designing an IRCTC-like system (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation) involves managing multiple elements such as trains, routes, passengers, reservations, ticket pricing, and concurrent booking. This requires designing a scalable database schema, implementing complex queries to handle routes and booking, and ensuring that concurrency is well-managed. Here’s an outline to cover each of the focus areas:

---

## **1. Database Schema Design**

### **Core Tables**
1. **Station**
   - `station_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `city`
   - `state`

2. **Train**
   - `train_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `type` (express, local, etc.)

3. **Route**
   - `route_id` (Primary Key)
   - `train_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Train`)
   - `origin_station_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Station`)
   - `destination_station_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Station`)
   - `distance` (in km)

4. **TrainSchedule**
   - `schedule_id` (Primary Key)
   - `train_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Train`)
   - `station_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Station`)
   - `arrival_time`
   - `departure_time`
   - `stop_number` (indicates the stop sequence on the route)

5. **Seat**
   - `seat_id` (Primary Key)
   - `train_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Train`)
   - `class` (e.g., sleeper, AC, non-AC)
   - `seat_number`

6. **Booking**
   - `booking_id` (Primary Key)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key referencing `User`)
   - `train_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Train`)
   - `route_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Route`)
   - `origin_station_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Station`)
   - `destination_station_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Station`)
   - `booking_date`
   - `travel_date`
   - `seat_id` (Foreign Key referencing `Seat`)
   - `status` (booked, cancelled, etc.)

7. **User**
   - `user_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `email`
   - `phone_number`

---

### **2. SQL Queries for Routes and Ticket Booking**

#### a. **Route Query**
To find the route and train options between two stations on a specific date:
- Select trains with schedules including both the origin and destination stations.
- Filter trains with an origin station’s `stop_number` less than the destination station’s `stop_number` (ensuring correct travel direction).

**Example Logic**:
1. Join `TrainSchedule` to `Route` and `Train` to fetch details for a particular date.
2. Filter by `origin_station_id` and `destination_station_id`, ordered by the schedule `stop_number`.

#### b. **Available Seats Query**
To check available seats on a specific route:
- Join the `Seat`, `Booking`, and `TrainSchedule` tables.
- Filter seats that are not already booked for the desired date.

**Example Logic**:
1. For a specific `train_id`, check the `Seat` table for available seats by `class`.
2. Exclude seats from the `Booking` table that are already booked for the travel date, route, and specified origin-destination stations.

#### c. **Booking Query**
To book a ticket:
- Reserve a seat if it’s available by creating an entry in the `Booking` table.
- Update the status of the booking to confirm.

**Example Logic**:
1. Check the `Seat` availability as per the query above.
2. Insert a new record in the `Booking` table with the required `user_id`, `train_id`, `seat_id`, etc.

---

### **3. Handling Concurrent Bookings**

Concurrency is essential to prevent multiple users from booking the same seat. Here are some techniques to manage this:

#### a. **Pessimistic Locking**
- Use database locking to **lock the seat records** being checked until the transaction completes.
- This prevents other transactions from reading or writing to the locked rows, ensuring that once a seat is confirmed as available, it cannot be double-booked.

#### b. **Optimistic Locking**
- Use an **optimistic lock** with a `version` field in the `Seat` table.
- When a seat is being updated, check the version, and if it has changed, abort the transaction, prompting the user to retry.

#### c. **Atomic Database Transactions**
- Use atomic transactions to ensure all related operations (seat check, booking creation, seat status update) happen together.
- If any part of the transaction fails, the entire operation is rolled back, preventing partial updates.

#### d. **Queue-Based Booking System**
- For high-load scenarios, a queuing system can be implemented to **manage booking requests sequentially**.
- Bookings are processed one by one in the queue, which reduces contention on the database and prevents race conditions.

---

## **Example Workflow for Booking Process**

1. **Seat Availability Check**:
   - Query available seats with filtering and concurrency handling as described.

2. **Begin Transaction**:
   - If using a relational database, start a transaction.

3. **Lock Seat**:
   - Lock the seat row to prevent access by other booking requests.

4. **Insert Booking**:
   - Insert a record in the `Booking` table with details of the passenger, route, and seat.

5. **Commit Transaction**:
   - Commit the transaction to finalize the booking.

6. **Release Locks**:
   - Release any locks held on seat rows to make them accessible for other users.

This design ensures data integrity, availability, and scalability, especially for a high-traffic system like IRCTC. Additional enhancements like caching commonly queried data (e.g., routes, train schedules) in Redis or another cache layer can further optimize performance and user experience.

To design an IRCTC-like system, we’ll list out the functional and non-functional requirements, then detail the APIs and services that should be implemented, including functional considerations. 

---

## **Functional Requirements**

1. **User Management**
   - Register, login, and manage user profiles.
   - Reset password functionality.
   
2. **Search & Route Management**
   - Search for trains based on origin, destination, date, and time.
   - Fetch and display train routes, including arrival and departure times at each station.

3. **Booking Management**
   - Book tickets with real-time seat availability checks.
   - View and manage bookings (view, cancel, reschedule).
   - Handle concurrent bookings to prevent double booking.

4. **Payment Processing**
   - Integrate payment gateway to process booking payments.
   - Handle payment status updates, cancellations, and refunds.

5. **Ticket Management**
   - Generate a digital ticket with details after a successful booking.
   - Send ticket confirmations via email or SMS.

6. **Notifications**
   - Send booking confirmations, reminders, and cancellation alerts.
   - Notify users of train delays or schedule changes.

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Scalability**
   - Should handle a large number of concurrent users and bookings, especially during peak times.

2. **Performance**
   - Fast response times for user interactions, particularly for ticket booking and train search.
   
3. **Availability**
   - Ensure high availability, as the system may be in demand 24/7.

4. **Data Consistency**
   - Ensure data consistency in transactions (e.g., booking, cancellation) to prevent double-booking.

5. **Security**
   - Use JWT for authentication.
   - Implement data encryption, secure payment processing, and protect user information.

6. **Maintainability**
   - Use modular services and proper documentation for easier updates and maintenance.

   - **Parameters**: `arrival_time`, `departure_time`, `station_order`
   - **Response**: Updated schedule details.

---

### **Functional Implementation Considerations**

- **Atomic Transactions for Bookings**: Each booking transaction should lock the seats and finalize only if payment succeeds. Use transactions to avoid partial updates.
  
- **Distributed Locking for Concurrency**: Implement a distributed locking mechanism (like Redis) for seat availability checks to prevent overselling in high-demand scenarios.

- **Session and Token Management**: Store tokens securely and implement session timeouts for active user sessions. Use JWT for user authentication and role-based authorization for admin actions.

- **Asynchronous Handling of Long Operations**: Background tasks like sending notifications or processing refunds should use asynchronous handling (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).

---

Here’s a sample implementation of the IRCTC-like system in Java with Spring Boot. The code covers essential aspects of the User, Train, and Booking services along with basic setups for database and REST endpoints.

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    Optional<User> findByUsername(String username);
}
```

#### b. `TrainRepository.java`

```java

}
```

#### c. `BookingRepository.java`

```java
@Repository
public interface BookingRepository extends JpaRepository<Booking, Long> {
    List<Booking> findByTrainAndTravelDate(Train train, LocalDate travelDate);
}
```

---

### **4. Service Layer**

#### a. `UserService.java`

```java
@Service
public class UserService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    public User registerUser(User user) {
        return userRepository.save(user);
    }

    public Optional<User> findByUsername(String username) {
        return userRepository.findByUsername(username);
    }
}
```

#### b. `BookingService.java`

```java
@Service
public class BookingService {

    @Autowired
    private BookingRepository bookingRepository;

    @Autowired
    private TrainRepository trainRepository;

    @Transactional
    public Booking createBooking(Long userId, Long trainId, LocalDate travelDate) {
        // Find the train by ID
        Train train = trainRepository.findById(trainId).orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Train not found"));

        // Check availability
        List<Booking> existingBookings = bookingRepository.findByTrainAndTravelDate(train, travelDate);
        if (existingBookings.size() >= train.getCapacity()) {
            throw new RuntimeException("No seats available");
        }

        // Create booking
        Booking booking = new Booking();
        booking.setUser(new User(userId));
        booking.setTrain(train);
        booking.setTravelDate(travelDate);
        booking.setStatus("BOOKED");

        return bookingRepository.save(booking);
    }
}
```

---

### **5. Controller Layer**

#### a. `UserController.java`

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;

    @PostMapping("/register")
    public ResponseEntity<User> registerUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        User registeredUser = userService.registerUser(user);
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(registeredUser);
    }
}
```

#### b. `BookingController.java`

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/bookings")
public class BookingController {

    @Autowired
    private BookingService bookingService;

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<Booking> createBooking(@RequestParam Long userId, @RequestParam Long trainId, @RequestParam LocalDate travelDate) {
        Booking booking = bookingService.createBooking(userId, trainId, travelDate);
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(booking);
    }
}
```

---

### **6. Security Configuration for JWT Authentication**

Here is a basic setup for securing the API endpoints:

#### `SecurityConfig.java`

```java
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable()
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/api/users/register", "/api/users/login").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);
        
        // JWT filter should be added here
    }
}
```

For production, add a JWT filter for token validation, and configure role-based access as needed.

---

### **7. Exception Handling**

To provide meaningful responses for errors, set up a custom exception handler:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(RuntimeException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleRuntimeException(RuntimeException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST).body(ex.getMessage());
    }
}
```

---

### **8. Testing and Running**

1. **Run Application**: With Spring Boot, simply run the `main` method in `Application.java` to start the application.
2. **API Testing**: Use a tool like Postman to test the endpoints. Begin by creating a user, then proceed to book tickets.

### **Next Steps**

For a production-ready implementation, consider:
- **Adding Redis or other cache** for frequently accessed data, like train schedules.
- **Implementing distributed locking** in the `BookingService` to handle concurrent bookings.
- **Configuring a messaging queue** for sending asynchronous notifications. 

This setup provides a foundation that can be enhanced based on additional requirements.
