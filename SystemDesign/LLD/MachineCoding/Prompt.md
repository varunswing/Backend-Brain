I will give you a low-level design / coding-round problem. Answer in the exact structure below, keeping explanations concise and focused for a 1-hour interview. Don’t add unnecessary extras.

**Problem:** <Describe the problem in 1–2 sentences.>

**Language:** <Java / Python / C++ / Go> (optional — default Java)

**Constraints / Scale (optional):** <expected objects, QPS, storage, custom rules>

Now produce the answer with these sections:

1. PROPER EXPLANATION TO CLARIFY THE QUESTION
   - Restate the problem in your own words (1–3 short bullets).
   - List any assumptions you are making (numbered).

2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (only required)
   - Numbered list of the core functions the system must support (brief).

3. ASCII CLASS DIAGRAM
   - Provide a compact ASCII class diagram showing the main classes, their fields (only key fields), and relationships (composition/inheritance/association). Keep it minimal.

4. HOW TO APPROACH & REQUIRED FUNCTIONS
   - Short step-by-step approach (3–6 steps).
   - Enumerate the methods/functions to implement (method signature style) with one-line description each.

5. DESIGN PATTERNS TO USE
   - List 1–3 relevant design patterns and a one-line reason for each.

6. REQUIRED INTERFACES
   - Provide concise interface definitions (name + methods) in pseudo-code or language-specific signatures. Only essential methods.

7. MODELS (DATA CLASSES)
   - Provide minimal model classes / DTOs with key fields and their types (language syntax).

8. FUNCTIONALITY (implementation notes)
   - For each core function from section 2, give a short, precise implementation plan (data structures, important algorithms, concurrency concerns). No boilerplate — only what’s needed to implement in 45–60 minutes.

9. (Optional) EDGE CASES & TESTS
   - 4–6 important edge cases to test and a one-line description for each.

**Answer constraints:** 
- Keep total length appropriate for a 1-hour coding+LLD interview (concise, focused).
- Prefer clarity over exhaustiveness.
- Use the chosen language’s syntax in interfaces/models.
