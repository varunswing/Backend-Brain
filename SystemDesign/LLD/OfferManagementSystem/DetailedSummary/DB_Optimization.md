Database Indexing and Optimization

Indexes: Create indexes on frequently queried columns like user_id, product_id, and order_id to improve query performance.

```sql
Copy code
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON orders(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_product_id ON inventory(product_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_id ON payments(order_id);
```

Partitioning: Consider partitioning large tables like orders and payments by date to improve performance and manageability.

Replication: Implement database replication for read-heavy operations to distribute load and increase availability.

Caching: Use caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed data such as product details and flash sale information.
