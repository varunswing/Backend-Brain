URL Shortener is a common low-level design (LLD) problem often encountered in system design interviews. The goal is to create a service that converts long URLs into shorter ones and retrieves the original URLs when given the short version.

## 1. Functional Requirements

**Shorten URL:** Convert a long URL into a short, unique URL.
**Retrieve URL:** Given a short URL, retrieve the original long URL.
**High Availability:** The system should be reliable, ensuring that short URLs are always available for redirection.
Scalability: The system should handle a large number of requests, potentially billions.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:** Low latency for generating and retrieving URLs.
**Scalability:** Should handle millions of URLs and scale horizontally.
**Security:** Protect against malicious URL submissions (e.g., spamming).

## 3. High-Level Design

**API Endpoints:**

POST /shorten: Accepts a long URL and returns a short URL.
GET /{shortUrl}: Redirects to the original long URL.
Core Components:

Service Layer: Handles the logic for URL shortening and retrieval.
Database: Stores mappings between short URLs and long URLs.
Encoding Service: Converts numeric IDs to short URLs using a base62 or similar encoding scheme.

## 4. Database Design

A simple key-value store can be used where:

**Key:** Short URL or a unique identifier.
**Value:** Long URL.
Example table structure:

**Table:** 
url_mapping
id (Primary Key, auto-incrementing): Unique identifier for each URL.
short_url (VARCHAR): The short version of the URL.
long_url (TEXT): The original long URL.

## 5. URL Shortening Process

**Generate Unique ID:**

Use an auto-incrementing ID or a UUID to ensure each URL gets a unique identifier.
Encode ID:

Convert the unique ID to a short string using base62 encoding (characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9).
Store in Database:

Save the mapping between the short URL and the long URL in the database.
Return the Short URL:

Return the short URL to the user, typically by appending the encoded string to a base domain (e.g., http://short.ly/{encoded_id}).

## 6. URL Redirection Process

**Receive Short URL:**

When a user accesses the short URL, extract the unique identifier.
Lookup in Database:

Query the database to retrieve the corresponding long URL.
Redirect:

Redirect the user to the long URL.

## 7. Handling Collisions

**Collision Detection:**

If using a hash function, ensure that collisions (two different URLs resulting in the same short URL) are handled by appending additional characters or retrying with a different hash.
Use of UUID:

UUIDs (universally unique identifiers) can be used to minimize the chance of collisions.

## 8. Scaling Considerations

**Database Sharding:**

Shard the database by short URL prefixes to distribute the load across multiple servers.
Caching:

Use a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed URL mappings, reducing database load.
Load Balancing:

Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and performance.

## 9. Security Considerations

**Rate Limiting:**

Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., a single user generating too many URLs in a short period).
Input Validation:

Validate URLs to ensure they are properly formatted and do not contain malicious content.
HTTPS:

Ensure that the service uses HTTPS to protect data in transit.

## 10. Example Code Implementation (Java)

Here is a basic Java implementation for a URL shortener:

```java
Copy code
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class UrlShortenerService {

    private static final String BASE_URL = "http://short.ly/";
    private static final String CHAR_SET = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789";
    private static final int BASE = CHAR_SET.length();
    private AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(1);
    private Map<String, String> shortToLongUrlMap = new HashMap<>();
    private Map<String, String> longToShortUrlMap = new HashMap<>();

    public String shortenUrl(String longUrl) {
        if (longToShortUrlMap.containsKey(longUrl)) {
            return BASE_URL + longToShortUrlMap.get(longUrl);
        }

        int id = counter.getAndIncrement();
        String shortUrl = encode(id);

        shortToLongUrlMap.put(shortUrl, longUrl);
        longToShortUrlMap.put(longUrl, shortUrl);

        return BASE_URL + shortUrl;
    }

    public String getLongUrl(String shortUrl) {
        String key = shortUrl.replace(BASE_URL, "");
        return shortToLongUrlMap.get(key);
    }

    private String encode(int id) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (id > 0) {
            sb.append(CHAR_SET.charAt(id % BASE));
            id /= BASE;
        }
        return sb.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```

## 11. Optimizations and Enhancements

**Custom Short URLs:** Allow users to specify custom aliases for their short URLs.
URL Expiration: Implement expiration dates for short URLs, automatically cleaning up old URLs.
**Analytics:** Track and report how often a short URL is accessed.

## 12. Discussion Points

**Trade-offs:** Discuss the trade-offs between using an auto-incrementing ID vs. a hash-based approach for generating short URLs.
**Scaling Strategy:** Explain how you would scale the service to handle millions or billions of URLs, including considerations for database sharding, caching, and load balancing.
Security Measures: Talk about how to protect the service from abuse and ensure that URLs are not malicious.
This design should give you a strong foundation to discuss and implement a URL shortener system during an interview.
