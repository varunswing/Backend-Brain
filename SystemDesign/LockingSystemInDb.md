In database and concurrent system environments, locking mechanisms help manage access to shared resources and ensure data consistency. Two common types of locking are optimistic locking and pessimistic locking. Here’s how they differ:

## 1. Optimistic Locking:
Concept: Assumes that multiple transactions can complete without interfering with each other and conflicts are rare.
How It Works: It doesn’t lock resources during the transaction. Instead, it checks for conflicts at the end, typically using a version number or timestamp.
Steps:
A transaction reads the data and does its processing.
Before writing the changes back, it checks if the data has been modified by another transaction during its work.
If there’s no conflict (i.e., no other transaction changed the data), the transaction succeeds.
If another transaction modified the data, it fails, and the operation may retry.
Use Case: Best for scenarios where conflicts are rare, like read-heavy systems, and you want to avoid unnecessary locking.
Example: Version control systems or in distributed environments where multiple services interact with the same dataset.

## 2. Pessimistic Locking:
Concept: Assumes that conflicts are common, and therefore locks resources early to prevent conflicts.
How It Works: Locks the resource (like a database row or table) when a transaction starts, and the lock is only released after the transaction is completed (commit or rollback).
Steps:
A transaction locks the data/resource for exclusive use.
Other transactions trying to access this locked data are blocked until the lock is released.
After the transaction completes, the lock is released, allowing others to proceed.
Use Case: Best for systems where conflicts are frequent, like write-heavy systems where the cost of retrying is high.
Example: In banking systems, where accurate and consistent transaction processing is critical.
Key Differences:
Aspect	Optimistic Locking	Pessimistic Locking
Locking Strategy	No lock during processing, check for conflicts later.	Lock resource at the start to avoid conflicts.
Performance	Better in low-contention systems (less locking).	Better in high-contention systems (prevents retries).
Conflict Handling	Detects conflicts at commit time.	Prevents conflicts by locking resources upfront.
Blocking	Does not block other transactions.	Can block other transactions, leading to delays.
Use Cases	Scenarios with low contention, read-heavy systems.	Write-heavy or contention-heavy systems.
Which type is best for your use case depends on the system's load patterns and the frequency of data conflicts.
